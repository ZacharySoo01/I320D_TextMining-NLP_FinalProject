"Emotion Ratings: How Intensity, Annotation Confidence and Agreements are   Entangled","When humans judge the affective content of texts, they also implicitly assess the correctness of such judgment, that is, their confidence. We hypothesize that people's (in)confidence that they performed well in an annotation task leads to (dis)agreements among each other. If this is true, confidence may serve as a diagnostic tool for systematic differences in annotations. To probe our assumption, we conduct a study on a subset of the Corpus of Contemporary American English, in which we ask raters to distinguish neutral sentences from emotion-bearing ones, while scoring the confidence of their answers. Confidence turns out to approximate inter-annotator disagreements. Further, we find that confidence is correlated to emotion intensity: perceiving stronger affect in text prompts annotators to more certain classification performances. This insight is relevant for modelling studies of intensity, as it opens the question wether automatic regressors or classifiers actually predict intensity, or rather human's self-perceived confidence."
AraBERT and Farasa Segmentation Based Approach For Sarcasm and Sentiment   Detection in Arabic Tweets,"This paper presents our strategy to tackle the EACL WANLP-2021 Shared Task 2: Sarcasm and Sentiment Detection. One of the subtasks aims at developing a system that identifies whether a given Arabic tweet is sarcastic in nature or not, while the other aims to identify the sentiment of the Arabic tweet. We approach the task in two steps. The first step involves pre processing the provided ArSarcasm-v2 dataset by performing insertions, deletions and segmentation operations on various parts of the text. The second step involves experimenting with multiple variants of two transformer based models, AraELECTRA and AraBERT. Our final approach was ranked seventh and fourth in the Sarcasm and Sentiment Detection subtasks respectively."
Conversational Norms for Human-Robot Dialogues,"This paper describes a recently initiated research project aiming at supporting development of computerised dialogue systems that handle breaches of conversational norms such as the Gricean maxims, which describe how dialogue participants ideally form their utterances in order to be informative, relevant, brief, etc. Our approach is to model dialogue and norms with co-operating distributed grammar systems (CDGSs), and to develop methods to detect breaches and to handle them in dialogue systems for verbal human-robot interaction."
The Rediscovery Hypothesis: Language Models Need to Meet Linguistics,"There is an ongoing debate in the NLP community whether modern language models contain linguistic knowledge, recovered through so-called probes. In this paper, we study whether linguistic knowledge is a necessary condition for the good performance of modern language models, which we call the \textit{rediscovery hypothesis}. In the first place, we show that language models that are significantly compressed but perform well on their pretraining objectives retain good scores when probed for linguistic structures. This result supports the rediscovery hypothesis and leads to the second contribution of our paper: an information-theoretic framework that relates language modeling objectives with linguistic information. This framework also provides a metric to measure the impact of linguistic information on the word prediction task. We reinforce our analytical results with various experiments, both on synthetic and on real NLP tasks in English."
MultiSubs: A Large-scale Multimodal and Multilingual Dataset,"This paper introduces a large-scale multimodal and multilingual dataset that aims to facilitate research on grounding words to images in their contextual usage in language. The dataset consists of images selected to unambiguously illustrate concepts expressed in sentences from movie subtitles. The dataset is a valuable resource as (i) the images are aligned to text fragments rather than whole sentences; (ii) multiple images are possible for a text fragment and a sentence; (iii) the sentences are free-form and real-world like; (iv) the parallel texts are multilingual. We set up a fill-in-the-blank game for humans to evaluate the quality of the automatic image selection process of our dataset. We show the utility of the dataset on two automatic tasks: (i) fill-in-the-blank; (ii) lexical translation. Results of the human evaluation and automatic models demonstrate that images can be a useful complement to the textual context. The dataset will benefit research on visual grounding of words especially in the context of free-form sentences, and can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5034604 under a Creative Commons licence."
Random Feature Attention,"Transformers are state-of-the-art models for a variety of sequence modeling tasks. At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints."
Gradual Fine-Tuning for Low-Resource Domain Adaptation,Fine-tuning is known to improve NLP models by adapting an initial model trained on more plentiful but less domain-salient examples to data in a target domain. Such domain adaptation is typically done using one stage of fine-tuning. We demonstrate that gradually fine-tuning in a multi-stage process can yield substantial further gains and can be applied without modifying the model or learning objective.
Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing through Contextual Embedding   Transformation,"Linear embedding transformation has been shown to be effective for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks and achieve surprisingly promising results. However, cross-lingual embedding space mapping is usually studied in static word-level embeddings, where a space transformation is derived by aligning representations of translation pairs that are referred from dictionaries. We move further from this line and investigate a contextual embedding alignment approach which is sense-level and dictionary-free. To enhance the quality of the mapping, we also provide a deep view of properties of contextual embeddings, i.e., anisotropy problem and its solution. Experiments on zero-shot dependency parsing through the concept-shared space built by our embedding transformation substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods using multilingual embeddings."
Data Augmentation with Hierarchical SQL-to-Question Generation for   Cross-domain Text-to-SQL Parsing,"Data augmentation has attracted a lot of research attention in the deep learning era for its ability in alleviating data sparseness. The lack of labeled data for unseen evaluation databases is exactly the major challenge for cross-domain text-to-SQL parsing. Previous works either require human intervention to guarantee the quality of generated data, or fail to handle complex SQL queries. This paper presents a simple yet effective data augmentation framework. First, given a database, we automatically produce a large number of SQL queries based on an abstract syntax tree grammar. For better distribution matching, we require that at least 80% of SQL patterns in the training data are covered by generated queries. Second, we propose a hierarchical SQL-to-question generation model to obtain high-quality natural language questions, which is the major contribution of this work. Finally, we design a simple sampling strategy that can greatly improve training efficiency given large amounts of generated data. Experiments on three cross-domain datasets, i.e., WikiSQL and Spider in English, and DuSQL in Chinese, show that our proposed data augmentation framework can consistently improve performance over strong baselines, and the hierarchical generation component is the key for the improvement."
Lex2vec: making Explainable Word Embeddings via Lexical Resources,"In this technical report, we propose an algorithm, called Lex2vec that exploits lexical resources to inject information into word embeddings and name the embedding dimensions by means of knowledge bases. We evaluate the optimal parameters to extract a number of informative labels that is readable and has a good coverage for the embedding dimensions."
An Empirical Study of Compound PCFGs,"Compound probabilistic context-free grammars (C-PCFGs) have recently established a new state of the art for unsupervised phrase-structure grammar induction. However, due to the high space and time complexities of chart-based representation and inference, it is difficult to investigate C-PCFGs comprehensively. In this work, we rely on a fast implementation of C-PCFGs to conduct an evaluation complementary to that of~\citet{kim-etal-2019-compound}. We start by analyzing and ablating C-PCFGs on English treebanks. Our findings suggest that (1) C-PCFGs are data-efficient and can generalize to unseen sentence/constituent lengths; and (2) C-PCFGs make the best use of sentence-level information in generating preterminal rule probabilities. We further conduct a multilingual evaluation of C-PCFGs. The experimental results show that the best configurations of C-PCFGs, which are tuned on English, do not always generalize to morphology-rich languages."
Few-shot Learning for Slot Tagging with Attentive Relational Network,"Metric-based learning is a well-known family of methods for few-shot learning, especially in computer vision. Recently, they have been used in many natural language processing applications but not for slot tagging. In this paper, we explore metric-based learning methods in the slot tagging task and propose a novel metric-based learning architecture - Attentive Relational Network. Our proposed method extends relation networks, making them more suitable for natural language processing applications in general, by leveraging pretrained contextual embeddings such as ELMO and BERT and by using attention mechanism. The results on SNIPS data show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art metric-based learning methods."
OAG-BERT: Towards A Unified Backbone Language Model For Academic   Knowledge Services,"Academic knowledge services have substantially facilitated the development of the science enterprise by providing a plenitude of efficient research tools. However, many applications highly depend on ad-hoc models and expensive human labeling to understand scientific contents, hindering deployments into real products. To build a unified backbone language model for different knowledge-intensive academic applications, we pre-train an academic language model OAG-BERT that integrates both the heterogeneous entity knowledge and scientific corpora in the Open Academic Graph (OAG) -- the largest public academic graph to date. In OAG-BERT, we develop strategies for pre-training text and entity data along with zero-shot inference techniques. In OAG-BERT, we develop strategies for pre-training text and entity data along with zero-shot inference techniques. Its zero-shot capability furthers the path to mitigate the need of expensive annotations. OAG-BERT has been deployed for real-world applications, such as the reviewer recommendation function for National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) -- one of the largest funding agencies in China -- and paper tagging in AMiner. All codes and pre-trained models are available via the CogDL toolkit."
NeurIPS 2020 NLC2CMD Competition: Translating Natural Language to Bash   Commands,"The NLC2CMD Competition hosted at NeurIPS 2020 aimed to bring the power of natural language processing to the command line. Participants were tasked with building models that can transform descriptions of command line tasks in English to their Bash syntax. This is a report on the competition with details of the task, metrics, data, attempted solutions, and lessons learned."
NaturalConv: A Chinese Dialogue Dataset Towards Multi-turn Topic-driven   Conversation,"In this paper, we propose a Chinese multi-turn topic-driven conversation dataset, NaturalConv, which allows the participants to chat anything they want as long as any element from the topic is mentioned and the topic shift is smooth. Our corpus contains 19.9K conversations from six domains, and 400K utterances with an average turn number of 20.1. These conversations contain in-depth discussions on related topics or widely natural transition between multiple topics. We believe either way is normal for human conversation. To facilitate the research on this corpus, we provide results of several benchmark models. Comparative results show that for this dataset, our current models are not able to provide significant improvement by introducing background knowledge/topic. Therefore, the proposed dataset should be a good benchmark for further research to evaluate the validity and naturalness of multi-turn conversation systems. Our dataset is available at https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/dialogue/#datasets."
Detecting Extraneous Content in Podcasts,"Podcast episodes often contain material extraneous to the main content, such as advertisements, interleaved within the audio and the written descriptions. We present classifiers that leverage both textual and listening patterns in order to detect such content in podcast descriptions and audio transcripts. We demonstrate that our models are effective by evaluating them on the downstream task of podcast summarization and show that we can substantively improve ROUGE scores and reduce the extraneous content generated in the summaries."
A Survey on Spoken Language Understanding: Recent Advances and New   Frontiers,"Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) aims to extract the semantics frame of user queries, which is a core component in a task-oriented dialog system. With the burst of deep neural networks and the evolution of pre-trained language models, the research of SLU has obtained significant breakthroughs. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing existing approaches and recent trends, which motivated the work presented in this article. In this paper, we survey recent advances and new frontiers in SLU. Specifically, we give a thorough review of this research field, covering different aspects including (1) new taxonomy: we provide a new perspective for SLU filed, including single model vs. joint model, implicit joint modeling vs. explicit joint modeling in joint model, non pre-trained paradigm vs. pre-trained paradigm;(2) new frontiers: some emerging areas in complex SLU as well as the corresponding challenges; (3) abundant open-source resources: to help the community, we have collected, organized the related papers, baseline projects and leaderboard on a public website where SLU researchers could directly access to the recent progress. We hope that this survey can shed a light on future research in SLU field."
An Empirical Study of End-to-end Simultaneous Speech Translation   Decoding Strategies,This paper proposes a decoding strategy for end-to-end simultaneous speech translation. We leverage end-to-end models trained in offline mode and conduct an empirical study for two language pairs (English-to-German and English-to-Portuguese). We also investigate different output token granularities including characters and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) units. The results show that the proposed decoding approach allows to control BLEU/Average Lagging trade-off along different latency regimes. Our best decoding settings achieve comparable results with a strong cascade model evaluated on the simultaneous translation track of IWSLT 2020 shared task.
Enhanced Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Models with Progressive   Self-supervised Attention Learning,"In aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), many neural models are equipped with an attention mechanism to quantify the contribution of each context word to sentiment prediction. However, such a mechanism suffers from one drawback: only a few frequent words with sentiment polarities are tended to be taken into consideration for final sentiment decision while abundant infrequent sentiment words are ignored by models. To deal with this issue, we propose a progressive self-supervised attention learning approach for attentional ABSA models. In this approach, we iteratively perform sentiment prediction on all training instances, and continually learn useful attention supervision information in the meantime. During training, at each iteration, context words with the highest impact on sentiment prediction, identified based on their attention weights or gradients, are extracted as words with active/misleading influence on the correct/incorrect prediction for each instance. Words extracted in this way are masked for subsequent iterations. To exploit these extracted words for refining ABSA models, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization term that encourages ABSA models to not only take full advantage of the extracted active context words but also decrease the weights of those misleading words. We integrate the proposed approach into three state-of-the-art neural ABSA models. Experiment results and in-depth analyses show that our approach yields better attention results and significantly enhances the performance of all three models. We release the source code and trained models at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/PSSAttention."
Syntactic and Semantic-driven Learning for Open Information Extraction,"One of the biggest bottlenecks in building accurate, high coverage neural open IE systems is the need for large labelled corpora. The diversity of open domain corpora and the variety of natural language expressions further exacerbate this problem. In this paper, we propose a syntactic and semantic-driven learning approach, which can learn neural open IE models without any human-labelled data by leveraging syntactic and semantic knowledge as noisier, higher-level supervisions. Specifically, we first employ syntactic patterns as data labelling functions and pretrain a base model using the generated labels. Then we propose a syntactic and semantic-driven reinforcement learning algorithm, which can effectively generalize the base model to open situations with high accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the supervised counterparts, and can even achieve competitive performance to supervised state-of-the-art (SoA) model"
Dual Pointer Network for Fast Extraction of Multiple Relations in a   Sentence,"Relation extraction is a type of information extraction task that recognizes semantic relationships between entities in a sentence. Many previous studies have focused on extracting only one semantic relation between two entities in a single sentence. However, multiple entities in a sentence are associated through various relations. To address this issue, we propose a relation extraction model based on a dual pointer network with a multi-head attention mechanism. The proposed model finds n-to-1 subject-object relations using a forward object decoder. Then, it finds 1-to-n subject-object relations using a backward subject decoder. Our experiments confirmed that the proposed model outperformed previous models, with an F1-score of 80.8% for the ACE-2005 corpus and an F1-score of 78.3% for the NYT corpus."
Graph-Based Tri-Attention Network for Answer Ranking in CQA,"In community-based question answering (CQA) platforms, automatic answer ranking for a given question is critical for finding potentially popular answers in early times. The mainstream approaches learn to generate answer ranking scores based on the matching degree between question and answer representations as well as the influence of respondents. However, they encounter two main limitations: (1) Correlations between answers in the same question are often overlooked. (2) Question and respondent representations are built independently of specific answers before affecting answer representations. To address the limitations, we devise a novel graph-based tri-attention network, namely GTAN, which has two innovations. First, GTAN proposes to construct a graph for each question and learn answer correlations from each graph through graph neural networks (GNNs). Second, based on the representations learned from GNNs, an alternating tri-attention method is developed to alternatively build target-aware respondent representations, answer-specific question representations, and context-aware answer representations by attention computation. GTAN finally integrates the above representations to generate answer ranking scores. Experiments on three real-world CQA datasets demonstrate GTAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art answer ranking methods, validating the rationality of the network architecture."
Fine-tuning Pretrained Multilingual BERT Model for Indonesian   Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Although previous research on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Indonesian reviews in hotel domain has been conducted using CNN and XGBoost, its model did not generalize well in test data and high number of OOV words contributed to misclassification cases. Nowadays, most state-of-the-art results for wide array of NLP tasks are achieved by utilizing pretrained language representation. In this paper, we intend to incorporate one of the foremost language representation model, BERT, to perform ABSA in Indonesian reviews dataset. By combining multilingual BERT (m-BERT) with task transformation method, we manage to achieve significant improvement by 8% on the F1-score compared to the result from our previous study."
Multi-document Summarization using Semantic Role Labeling and Semantic   Graph for Indonesian News Article,"In this paper, we proposed a multi-document summarization system using semantic role labeling (SRL) and semantic graph for Indonesian news articles. In order to improve existing summarizer, our system modified summarizer that employed subject, predicate, object, and adverbial (SVOA) extraction for predicate argument structure (PAS) extraction. SVOA extraction is replaced with SRL model for Indonesian. We also replace the genetic algorithm to identify important PAS with the decision tree classifier since the summarizer without genetic algorithm gave better performance. The decision tree model is employed to identify important PAS. The decision tree model with 10 features achieved better performance than decision tree with 4 sentence features. Experiments and evaluations are conducted to generate 100 words summary and 200 words summary. The evaluation shows the proposed model get 0.313 average ROUGE-2 recall in 100 words summary and 0.394 average ROUGE-2 recall in 200 words summary."
Leveraging Recursive Processing for Neural-Symbolic Affect-Target   Associations,"Explaining the outcome of deep learning decisions based on affect is challenging but necessary if we expect social companion robots to interact with users on an emotional level. In this paper, we present a commonsense approach that utilizes an interpretable hybrid neural-symbolic system to associate extracted targets, noun chunks determined to be associated with the expressed emotion, with affective labels from a natural language expression. We leverage a pre-trained neural network that is well adapted to tree and sub-tree processing, the Dependency Tree-LSTM, to learn the affect labels of dynamic targets, determined through symbolic rules, in natural language. We find that making use of the unique properties of the recursive network provides higher accuracy and interpretability when compared to other unstructured and sequential methods for determining target-affect associations in an aspect-based sentiment analysis task."
"There Once Was a Really Bad Poet, It Was Automated but You Didn't Know   It","Limerick generation exemplifies some of the most difficult challenges faced in poetry generation, as the poems must tell a story in only five lines, with constraints on rhyme, stress, and meter. To address these challenges, we introduce LimGen, a novel and fully automated system for limerick generation that outperforms state-of-the-art neural network-based poetry models, as well as prior rule-based poetry models. LimGen consists of three important pieces: the Adaptive Multi-Templated Constraint algorithm that constrains our search to the space of realistic poems, the Multi-Templated Beam Search algorithm which searches efficiently through the space, and the probabilistic Storyline algorithm that provides coherent storylines related to a user-provided prompt word. The resulting limericks satisfy poetic constraints and have thematically coherent storylines, which are sometimes even funny (when we are lucky)."
AnswerQuest: A System for Generating Question-Answer Items from   Multi-Paragraph Documents,"One strategy for facilitating reading comprehension is to present information in a question-and-answer format. We demo a system that integrates the tasks of question answering (QA) and question generation (QG) in order to produce Q&A items that convey the content of multi-paragraph documents. We report some experiments for QA and QG that yield improvements on both tasks, and assess how they interact to produce a list of Q&A items for a text. The demo is accessible at qna.sdl.com."
Overcoming Poor Word Embeddings with Word Definitions,"Modern natural language understanding models depend on pretrained subword embeddings, but applications may need to reason about words that were never or rarely seen during pretraining. We show that examples that depend critically on a rarer word are more challenging for natural language inference models. Then we explore how a model could learn to use definitions, provided in natural text, to overcome this handicap. Our model's understanding of a definition is usually weaker than a well-modeled word embedding, but it recovers most of the performance gap from using a completely untrained word."
"Neural networks can understand compositional functions that humans do   not, in the context of emergent communication","We show that it is possible to craft transformations that, applied to compositional grammars, result in grammars that neural networks can learn easily, but humans do not. This could explain the disconnect between current metrics of compositionality, that are arguably human-centric, and the ability of neural networks to generalize to unseen examples. We propose to use the transformations as a benchmark, ICY, which could be used to measure aspects of the compositional inductive bias of networks, and to search for networks with similar compositional inductive biases to humans. As an example of this approach, we propose a hierarchical model, HU-RNN, which shows an inductive bias towards position-independent, word-like groups of tokens."
MTLHealth: A Deep Learning System for Detecting Disturbing Content in   Student Essays,"Essay submissions to standardized tests like the ACT occasionally include references to bullying, self-harm, violence, and other forms of disturbing content. Graders must take great care to identify cases like these and decide whether to alert authorities on behalf of students who may be in danger. There is a growing need for robust computer systems to support human decision-makers by automatically flagging potential instances of disturbing content. This paper describes MTLHealth, a disturbing content detection pipeline built around recent advances from computational linguistics, particularly pre-trained language model Transformer networks."
Syntax-BERT: Improving Pre-trained Transformers with Syntax Trees,"Pre-trained language models like BERT achieve superior performances in various NLP tasks without explicit consideration of syntactic information. Meanwhile, syntactic information has been proved to be crucial for the success of NLP applications. However, how to incorporate the syntax trees effectively and efficiently into pre-trained Transformers is still unsettled. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel framework named Syntax-BERT. This framework works in a plug-and-play mode and is applicable to an arbitrary pre-trained checkpoint based on Transformer architecture. Experiments on various datasets of natural language understanding verify the effectiveness of syntax trees and achieve consistent improvement over multiple pre-trained models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and T5."
Empathetic BERT2BERT Conversational Model: Learning Arabic Language   Generation with Little Data,"Enabling empathetic behavior in Arabic dialogue agents is an important aspect of building human-like conversational models. While Arabic Natural Language Processing has seen significant advances in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with language models such as AraBERT, Natural Language Generation (NLG) remains a challenge. The shortcomings of NLG encoder-decoder models are primarily due to the lack of Arabic datasets suitable to train NLG models such as conversational agents. To overcome this issue, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder initialized with AraBERT parameters. By initializing the weights of the encoder and decoder with AraBERT pre-trained weights, our model was able to leverage knowledge transfer and boost performance in response generation. To enable empathy in our conversational model, we train it using the ArabicEmpatheticDialogues dataset and achieve high performance in empathetic response generation. Specifically, our model achieved a low perplexity value of 17.0 and an increase in 5 BLEU points compared to the previous state-of-the-art model. Also, our proposed model was rated highly by 85 human evaluators, validating its high capability in exhibiting empathy while generating relevant and fluent responses in open-domain settings."
Automatic Difficulty Classification of Arabic Sentences,"In this paper, we present a Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) Sentence difficulty classifier, which predicts the difficulty of sentences for language learners using either the CEFR proficiency levels or the binary classification as simple or complex. We compare the use of sentence embeddings of different kinds (fastText, mBERT , XLM-R and Arabic-BERT), as well as traditional language features such as POS tags, dependency trees, readability scores and frequency lists for language learners. Our best results have been achieved using fined-tuned Arabic-BERT. The accuracy of our 3-way CEFR classification is F-1 of 0.80 and 0.75 for Arabic-Bert and XLM-R classification respectively and 0.71 Spearman correlation for regression. Our binary difficulty classifier reaches F-1 0.94 and F-1 0.98 for sentence-pair semantic similarity classifier."
Improving Text-to-SQL with Schema Dependency Learning,"Text-to-SQL aims to map natural language questions to SQL queries. The sketch-based method combined with execution-guided (EG) decoding strategy has shown a strong performance on the WikiSQL benchmark. However, execution-guided decoding relies on database execution, which significantly slows down the inference process and is hence unsatisfactory for many real-world applications. In this paper, we present the Schema Dependency guided multi-task Text-to-SQL model (SDSQL) to guide the network to effectively capture the interactions between questions and schemas. The proposed model outperforms all existing methods in both the settings with or without EG. We show the schema dependency learning partially cover the benefit from EG and alleviates the need for it. SDSQL without EG significantly reduces time consumption during inference, sacrificing only a small amount of performance and provides more flexibility for downstream applications."
"Sharks are not the threat humans are"": Argument Component Segmentation   in School Student Essays","Argument mining is often addressed by a pipeline method where segmentation of text into argumentative units is conducted first and proceeded by an argument component identification task. In this research, we apply a token-level classification to identify claim and premise tokens from a new corpus of argumentative essays written by middle school students. To this end, we compare a variety of state-of-the-art models such as discrete features and deep learning architectures (e.g., BiLSTM networks and BERT-based architectures) to identify the argument components. We demonstrate that a BERT-based multi-task learning architecture (i.e., token and sentence level classification) adaptively pretrained on a relevant unlabeled dataset obtains the best results"
MCR-Net: A Multi-Step Co-Interactive Relation Network for Unanswerable   Questions on Machine Reading Comprehension,"Question answering systems usually use keyword searches to retrieve potential passages related to a question, and then extract the answer from passages with the machine reading comprehension methods. However, many questions tend to be unanswerable in the real world. In this case, it is significant and challenging how the model determines when no answer is supported by the passage and abstains from answering. Most of the existing systems design a simple classifier to determine answerability implicitly without explicitly modeling mutual interaction and relation between the question and passage, leading to the poor performance for determining the unanswerable questions. To tackle this problem, we propose a Multi-Step Co-Interactive Relation Network (MCR-Net) to explicitly model the mutual interaction and locate key clues from coarse to fine by introducing a co-interactive relation module. The co-interactive relation module contains a stack of interaction and fusion blocks to continuously integrate and fuse history-guided and current-query-guided clues in an explicit way. Experiments on the SQuAD 2.0 and DuReader datasets show that our model achieves a remarkable improvement, outperforming the BERT-style baselines in literature. Visualization analysis also verifies the importance of the mutual interaction between the question and passage."
InFillmore: Frame-Guided Language Generation with Bidirectional Context,"We propose a structured extension to bidirectional-context conditional language generation, or ""infilling,"" inspired by Frame Semantic theory (Fillmore, 1976). Guidance is provided through two approaches: (1) model fine-tuning, conditioning directly on observed symbolic frames, and (2) a novel extension to disjunctive lexically constrained decoding that leverages frame semantic lexical units. Automatic and human evaluations confirm that frame-guided generation allows for explicit manipulation of intended infill semantics, with minimal loss in distinguishability from human-generated text. Our methods flexibly apply to a variety of use scenarios, and we provide a codebase and interactive demo available from https://nlp.jhu.edu/demos/infillmore."
Fast and Effective Biomedical Entity Linking Using a Dual Encoder,"Biomedical entity linking is the task of identifying mentions of biomedical concepts in text documents and mapping them to canonical entities in a target thesaurus. Recent advancements in entity linking using BERT-based models follow a retrieve and rerank paradigm, where the candidate entities are first selected using a retriever model, and then the retrieved candidates are ranked by a reranker model. While this paradigm produces state-of-the-art results, they are slow both at training and test time as they can process only one mention at a time. To mitigate these issues, we propose a BERT-based dual encoder model that resolves multiple mentions in a document in one shot. We show that our proposed model is multiple times faster than existing BERT-based models while being competitive in accuracy for biomedical entity linking. Additionally, we modify our dual encoder model for end-to-end biomedical entity linking that performs both mention span detection and entity disambiguation and out-performs two recently proposed models."
Domain Controlled Title Generation with Human Evaluation,"We study automatic title generation and present a method for generating domain-controlled titles for scientific articles. A good title allows you to get the attention that your research deserves. A title can be interpreted as a high-compression description of a document containing information on the implemented process. For domain-controlled titles, we used the pre-trained text-to-text transformer model and the additional token technique. Title tokens are sampled from a local distribution (which is a subset of global vocabulary) of the domain-specific vocabulary and not global vocabulary, thereby generating a catchy title and closely linking it to its corresponding abstract. Generated titles looked realistic, convincing, and very close to the ground truth. We have performed automated evaluation using ROUGE metric and human evaluation using five parameters to make a comparison between human and machine-generated titles. The titles produced were considered acceptable with higher metric ratings in contrast to the original titles. Thus we concluded that our research proposes a promising method for domain-controlled title generation."
Few-Shot Learning of an Interleaved Text Summarization Model by   Pretraining with Synthetic Data,"Interleaved texts, where posts belonging to different threads occur in a sequence, commonly occur in online chat posts, so that it can be time-consuming to quickly obtain an overview of the discussions. Existing systems first disentangle the posts by threads and then extract summaries from those threads. A major issue with such systems is error propagation from the disentanglement component. While end-to-end trainable summarization system could obviate explicit disentanglement, such systems require a large amount of labeled data. To address this, we propose to pretrain an end-to-end trainable hierarchical encoder-decoder system using synthetic interleaved texts. We show that by fine-tuning on a real-world meeting dataset (AMI), such a system out-performs a traditional two-step system by 22%. We also compare against transformer models and observed that pretraining with synthetic data both the encoder and decoder outperforms the BertSumExtAbs transformer model which pretrains only the encoder on a large dataset."
A Topological Approach to Compare Document Semantics Based on a New   Variant of Syntactic N-grams,"This paper delivers a new perspective of thinking and utilizing syntactic n-grams (sn-grams). Sn-grams are a type of non-linear n-grams which have been playing a critical role in many NLP tasks. Introducing sn-grams to comparing document semantics thus is an appealing application, and few studies have reported progress at this. However, when proceeding on this application, we found three major issues of sn-grams: lack of significance, being sensitive to word orders and failing on capture indirect syntactic relations. To address these issues, we propose a new variant of sn-grams named generalized phrases (GPs). Then based on GPs we propose a topological approach, named DSCoH, to compute document semantic similarities. DSCoH has been extensively tested on the document semantics comparison and the document clustering tasks. The experimental results show that DSCoH can outperform state-of-the-art embedding-based methods."
Contrastive Semi-supervised Learning for ASR,"Pseudo-labeling is the most adopted method for pre-training automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. However, its performance suffers from the supervised teacher model's degrading quality in low-resource setups and under domain transfer. Inspired by the successes of contrastive representation learning for computer vision and speech applications, and more recently for supervised learning of visual objects, we propose Contrastive Semi-supervised Learning (CSL). CSL eschews directly predicting teacher-generated pseudo-labels in favor of utilizing them to select positive and negative examples. In the challenging task of transcribing public social media videos, using CSL reduces the WER by 8% compared to the standard Cross-Entropy pseudo-labeling (CE-PL) when 10hr of supervised data is used to annotate 75,000hr of videos. The WER reduction jumps to 19% under the ultra low-resource condition of using 1hr labels for teacher supervision. CSL generalizes much better in out-of-domain conditions, showing up to 17% WER reduction compared to the best CE-PL pre-trained model."
Improving Document-Level Sentiment Classification Using Importance of   Sentences,"Previous researchers have considered sentiment analysis as a document classification task, in which input documents are classified into predefined sentiment classes. Although there are sentences in a document that support important evidences for sentiment analysis and sentences that do not, they have treated the document as a bag of sentences. In other words, they have not considered the importance of each sentence in the document. To effectively determine polarity of a document, each sentence in the document should be dealt with different degrees of importance. To address this problem, we propose a document-level sentence classification model based on deep neural networks, in which the importance degrees of sentences in documents are automatically determined through gate mechanisms. To verify our new sentiment analysis model, we conducted experiments using the sentiment datasets in the four different domains such as movie reviews, hotel reviews, restaurant reviews, and music reviews. In the experiments, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models that do not consider importance differences of sentences in a document. The experimental results show that the importance of sentences should be considered in a document-level sentiment classification task."
Detecting Inappropriate Messages on Sensitive Topics that Could Harm a   Company's Reputation,"Not all topics are equally ""flammable"" in terms of toxicity: a calm discussion of turtles or fishing less often fuels inappropriate toxic dialogues than a discussion of politics or sexual minorities. We define a set of sensitive topics that can yield inappropriate and toxic messages and describe the methodology of collecting and labeling a dataset for appropriateness. While toxicity in user-generated data is well-studied, we aim at defining a more fine-grained notion of inappropriateness. The core of inappropriateness is that it can harm the reputation of a speaker. This is different from toxicity in two respects: (i) inappropriateness is topic-related, and (ii) inappropriate message is not toxic but still unacceptable. We collect and release two datasets for Russian: a topic-labeled dataset and an appropriateness-labeled dataset. We also release pre-trained classification models trained on this data."
Tell Me Why You Feel That Way: Processing Compositional Dependency for   Tree-LSTM Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (TASTE),"Sentiment analysis has transitioned from classifying the sentiment of an entire sentence to providing the contextual information of what targets exist in a sentence, what sentiment the individual targets have, and what the causal words responsible for that sentiment are. However, this has led to elaborate requirements being placed on the datasets needed to train neural networks on the joint triplet task of determining an entity, its sentiment, and the causal words for that sentiment. Requiring this kind of data for training systems is problematic, as they suffer from stacking subjective annotations and domain over-fitting leading to poor model generalisation when applied in new contexts. These problems are also likely to be compounded as we attempt to jointly determine additional contextual elements in the future. To mitigate these problems, we present a hybrid neural-symbolic method utilising a Dependency Tree-LSTM's compositional sentiment parse structure and complementary symbolic rules to correctly extract target-sentiment-cause triplets from sentences without the need for triplet training data. We show that this method has the potential to perform in line with state-of-the-art approaches while also simplifying the data required and providing a degree of interpretability through the Tree-LSTM."
How does Truth Evolve into Fake News? An Empirical Study of Fake News   Evolution,"Automatically identifying fake news from the Internet is a challenging problem in deception detection tasks. Online news is modified constantly during its propagation, e.g., malicious users distort the original truth and make up fake news. However, the continuous evolution process would generate unprecedented fake news and cheat the original model. We present the Fake News Evolution (FNE) dataset: a new dataset tracking the fake news evolution process. Our dataset is composed of 950 paired data, each of which consists of articles representing the three significant phases of the evolution process, which are the truth, the fake news, and the evolved fake news. We observe the features during the evolution and they are the disinformation techniques, text similarity, top 10 keywords, classification accuracy, parts of speech, and sentiment properties."
Self-Learning for Zero Shot Neural Machine Translation,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approaches employing monolingual data are showing steady improvements in resource rich conditions. However, evaluations using real-world low-resource languages still result in unsatisfactory performance. This work proposes a novel zero-shot NMT modeling approach that learns without the now-standard assumption of a pivot language sharing parallel data with the zero-shot source and target languages. Our approach is based on three stages: initialization from any pre-trained NMT model observing at least the target language, augmentation of source sides leveraging target monolingual data, and learning to optimize the initial model to the zero-shot pair, where the latter two constitute a self-learning cycle. Empirical findings involving four diverse (in terms of a language family, script and relatedness) zero-shot pairs show the effectiveness of our approach with up to +5.93 BLEU improvement against a supervised bilingual baseline. Compared to unsupervised NMT, consistent improvements are observed even in a domain-mismatch setting, attesting to the usability of our method."
A Result based Portable Framework for Spoken Language Understanding,"Spoken language understanding (SLU), which is a core component of the task-oriented dialogue system, has made substantial progress in the research of single-turn dialogue. However, the performance in multi-turn dialogue is still not satisfactory in the sense that the existing multi-turn SLU methods have low portability and compatibility for other single-turn SLU models. Further, existing multi-turn SLU methods do not exploit the historical predicted results when predicting the current utterance, which wastes helpful information. To gap those shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Result-based Portable Framework for SLU (RPFSLU). RPFSLU allows most existing single-turn SLU models to obtain the contextual information from multi-turn dialogues and takes full advantage of predicted results in the dialogue history during the current prediction. Experimental results on the public dataset KVRET have shown that all SLU models in baselines acquire enhancement by RPFSLU on multi-turn SLU tasks."
Team Phoenix at WASSA 2021: Emotion Analysis on News Stories with   Pre-Trained Language Models,"Emotion is fundamental to humanity. The ability to perceive, understand and respond to social interactions in a human-like manner is one of the most desired capabilities in artificial agents, particularly in social-media bots. Over the past few years, computational understanding and detection of emotional aspects in language have been vital in advancing human-computer interaction. The WASSA Shared Task 2021 released a dataset of news-stories across two tracks, Track-1 for Empathy and Distress Prediction and Track-2 for Multi-Dimension Emotion prediction at the essay-level. We describe our system entry for the WASSA 2021 Shared Task (for both Track-1 and Track-2), where we leveraged the information from Pre-trained language models for Track-specific Tasks. Our proposed models achieved an Average Pearson Score of 0.417 and a Macro-F1 Score of 0.502 in Track 1 and Track 2, respectively. In the Shared Task leaderboard, we secured 4th rank in Track 1 and 2nd rank in Track 2."
Knowledge-based Extraction of Cause-Effect Relations from Biomedical   Text,"We propose a knowledge-based approach for extraction of Cause-Effect (CE) relations from biomedical text. Our approach is a combination of an unsupervised machine learning technique to discover causal triggers and a set of high-precision linguistic rules to identify cause/effect arguments of these causal triggers. We evaluate our approach using a corpus of 58,761 Leukaemia-related PubMed abstracts consisting of 568,528 sentences. We could extract 152,655 CE triplets from this corpus where each triplet consists of a cause phrase, an effect phrase and a causal trigger. As compared to the existing knowledge base - SemMedDB (Kilicoglu et al., 2012), the number of extractions are almost twice. Moreover, the proposed approach outperformed the existing technique SemRep (Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003) on a dataset of 500 sentences."
Techniques for Jointly Extracting Entities and Relations: A Survey,"Relation Extraction is an important task in Information Extraction which deals with identifying semantic relations between entity mentions. Traditionally, relation extraction is carried out after entity extraction in a ""pipeline"" fashion, so that relation extraction only focuses on determining whether any semantic relation exists between a pair of extracted entity mentions. This leads to propagation of errors from entity extraction stage to relation extraction stage. Also, entity extraction is carried out without any knowledge about the relations. Hence, it was observed that jointly performing entity and relation extraction is beneficial for both the tasks. In this paper, we survey various techniques for jointly extracting entities and relations. We categorize techniques based on the approach they adopt for joint extraction, i.e. whether they employ joint inference or joint modelling or both. We further describe some representative techniques for joint inference and joint modelling. We also describe two standard datasets, evaluation techniques and performance of the joint extraction approaches on these datasets. We present a brief analysis of application of a general domain joint extraction approach to a Biomedical dataset. This survey is useful for researchers as well as practitioners in the field of Information Extraction, by covering a broad landscape of joint extraction techniques."
Identifying ARDS using the Hierarchical Attention Network with Sentence   Objectives Framework,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition that is often undiagnosed or diagnosed late. ARDS is especially prominent in those infected with COVID-19. We explore the automatic identification of ARDS indicators and confounding factors in free-text chest radiograph reports. We present a new annotated corpus of chest radiograph reports and introduce the Hierarchical Attention Network with Sentence Objectives (HANSO) text classification framework. HANSO utilizes fine-grained annotations to improve document classification performance. HANSO can extract ARDS-related information with high performance by leveraging relation annotations, even if the annotated spans are noisy. Using annotated chest radiograph images as a gold standard, HANSO identifies bilateral infiltrates, an indicator of ARDS, in chest radiograph reports with performance (0.87 F1) comparable to human annotations (0.84 F1). This algorithm could facilitate more efficient and expeditious identification of ARDS by clinicians and researchers and contribute to the development of new therapies to improve patient care."
ReportAGE: Automatically extracting the exact age of Twitter users based   on self-reports in tweets,"Advancing the utility of social media data for research applications requires methods for automatically detecting demographic information about social media study populations, including users' age. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a method that automatically identifies the exact age of users based on self-reports in their tweets. Our end-to-end automatic natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, ReportAGE, includes query patterns to retrieve tweets that potentially mention an age, a classifier to distinguish retrieved tweets that self-report the user's exact age (""age"" tweets) and those that do not (""no age"" tweets), and rule-based extraction to identify the age. To develop and evaluate ReportAGE, we manually annotated 11,000 tweets that matched the query patterns. Based on 1000 tweets that were annotated by all five annotators, inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) was 0.80 for distinguishing ""age"" and ""no age"" tweets, and 0.95 for identifying the exact age among the ""age"" tweets on which the annotators agreed. A deep neural network classifier, based on a RoBERTa-Large pretrained model, achieved the highest F1-score of 0.914 (precision = 0.905, recall = 0.942) for the ""age"" class. When the age extraction was evaluated using the classifier's predictions, it achieved an F1-score of 0.855 (precision = 0.805, recall = 0.914) for the ""age"" class. When it was evaluated directly on the held-out test set, it achieved an F1-score of 0.931 (precision = 0.873, recall = 0.998) for the ""age"" class. We deployed ReportAGE on more than 1.2 billion tweets posted by 245,927 users, and predicted ages for 132,637 (54%) of them. Scaling the detection of exact age to this large number of users can advance the utility of social media data for research applications that do not align with the predefined age groupings of extant binary or multi-class classification approaches."
Self-supervised Text-to-SQL Learning with Header Alignment Training,"Since we can leverage a large amount of unlabeled data without any human supervision to train a model and transfer the knowledge to target tasks, self-supervised learning is a de-facto component for the recent success of deep learning in various fields. However, in many cases, there is a discrepancy between a self-supervised learning objective and a task-specific objective. In order to tackle such discrepancy in Text-to-SQL task, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework. We utilize the task-specific properties of Text-to-SQL task and the underlying structures of table contents to train the models to learn useful knowledge of the \textit{header-column} alignment task from unlabeled table data. We are able to transfer the knowledge to the supervised Text-to-SQL training with annotated samples, so that the model can leverage the knowledge to better perform the \textit{header-span} alignment task to predict SQL statements. Experimental results show that our self-supervised learning framework significantly improves the performance of the existing strong BERT based models without using large external corpora. In particular, our method is effective for training the model with scarce labeled data. The source code of this work is available in GitHub."
MediaSum: A Large-scale Media Interview Dataset for Dialogue   Summarization,"MediaSum, a large-scale media interview dataset consisting of 463.6K transcripts with abstractive summaries. To create this dataset, we collect interview transcripts from NPR and CNN and employ the overview and topic descriptions as summaries. Compared with existing public corpora for dialogue summarization, our dataset is an order of magnitude larger and contains complex multi-party conversations from multiple domains. We conduct statistical analysis to demonstrate the unique positional bias exhibited in the transcripts of televised and radioed interviews. We also show that MediaSum can be used in transfer learning to improve a model's performance on other dialogue summarization tasks."
LightMBERT: A Simple Yet Effective Method for Multilingual BERT   Distillation,"The multilingual pre-trained language models (e.g, mBERT, XLM and XLM-R) have shown impressive performance on cross-lingual natural language understanding tasks. However, these models are computationally intensive and difficult to be deployed on resource-restricted devices. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective distillation method (LightMBERT) for transferring the cross-lingual generalization ability of the multilingual BERT to a small student model. The experiment results empirically demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of LightMBERT, which is significantly better than the baselines and performs comparable to the teacher mBERT."
Conversational Answer Generation and Factuality for Reading   Comprehension Question-Answering,"Question answering (QA) is an important use case on voice assistants. A popular approach to QA is extractive reading comprehension (RC) which finds an answer span in a text passage. However, extractive answers are often unnatural in a conversational context which results in suboptimal user experience. In this work, we investigate conversational answer generation for QA. We propose AnswerBART, an end-to-end generative RC model which combines answer generation from multiple passages with passage ranking and answerability. Moreover, a hurdle in applying generative RC are hallucinations where the answer is factually inconsistent with the passage text. We leverage recent work from summarization to evaluate factuality. Experiments show that AnswerBART significantly improves over previous best published results on MS MARCO 2.1 NLGEN by 2.5 ROUGE-L and NarrativeQA by 9.4 ROUGE-L."
Does the Magic of BERT Apply to Medical Code Assignment? A Quantitative   Study,"Unsupervised pretraining is an integral part of many natural language processing systems, and transfer learning with language models has achieved remarkable results in many downstream tasks. In the clinical application of medical code assignment, diagnosis and procedure codes are inferred from lengthy clinical notes such as hospital discharge summaries. However, it is not clear if pretrained models are useful for medical code prediction without further architecture engineering. This paper conducts a comprehensive quantitative analysis of various contextualized language models' performance, pretrained in different domains, for medical code assignment from clinical notes. We propose a hierarchical fine-tuning architecture to capture interactions between distant words and adopt label-wise attention to exploit label information. Contrary to current trends, we demonstrate that a carefully trained classical CNN outperforms attention-based models on a MIMIC-III subset with frequent codes. Our empirical findings suggest directions for improving the medical code assignment application."
DebIE: A Platform for Implicit and Explicit Debiasing of Word Embedding   Spaces,"Recent research efforts in NLP have demonstrated that distributional word vector spaces often encode stereotypical human biases, such as racism and sexism. With word representations ubiquitously used in NLP models and pipelines, this raises ethical issues and jeopardizes the fairness of language technologies. While there exists a large body of work on bias measures and debiasing methods, to date, there is no platform that would unify these research efforts and make bias measuring and debiasing of representation spaces widely accessible. In this work, we present DebIE, the first integrated platform for (1) measuring and (2) mitigating bias in word embeddings. Given an (i) embedding space (users can choose between the predefined spaces or upload their own) and (ii) a bias specification (users can choose between existing bias specifications or create their own), DebIE can (1) compute several measures of implicit and explicit bias and modify the embedding space by executing two (mutually composable) debiasing models. DebIE's functionality can be accessed through four different interfaces: (a) a web application, (b) a desktop application, (c) a REST-ful API, and (d) as a command-line application. DebIE is available at: debie.informatik.uni-mannheim.de."
ASAP: A Chinese Review Dataset Towards Aspect Category Sentiment   Analysis and Rating Prediction,"Sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention in e-commerce. The sentiment polarities underlying user reviews are of great value for business intelligence. Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and review rating prediction (RP) are two essential tasks to detect the fine-to-coarse sentiment polarities. %Considering the sentiment of the aspects(ACSA) and the overall review rating(RP) simultaneously has the potential to improve the overall performance. ACSA and RP are highly correlated and usually employed jointly in real-world e-commerce scenarios. While most public datasets are constructed for ACSA and RP separately, which may limit the further exploitation of both tasks. To address the problem and advance related researches, we present a large-scale Chinese restaurant review dataset \textbf{ASAP} including $46,730$ genuine reviews from a leading online-to-offline (O2O) e-commerce platform in China. Besides a $5$-star scale rating, each review is manually annotated according to its sentiment polarities towards $18$ pre-defined aspect categories. We hope the release of the dataset could shed some light on the fields of sentiment analysis. Moreover, we propose an intuitive yet effective joint model for ACSA and RP. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both tasks."
Domain State Tracking for a Simplified Dialogue System,"Task-oriented dialogue systems aim to help users achieve their goals in specific domains. Recent neural dialogue systems use the entire dialogue history for abundant contextual information accumulated over multiple conversational turns. However, the dialogue history becomes increasingly longer as the number of turns increases, thereby increasing memory usage and computational costs. In this paper, we present DoTS (Domain State Tracking for a Simplified Dialogue System), a task-oriented dialogue system that uses a simplified input context instead of the entire dialogue history. However, neglecting the dialogue history can result in a loss of contextual information from previous conversational turns. To address this issue, DoTS tracks the domain state in addition to the belief state and uses it for the input context. Using this simplified input, DoTS improves the inform rate and success rate by 1.09 points and 1.24 points, respectively, compared to the previous state-of-the-art model on MultiWOZ, which is a well-known benchmark."
"The Interplay of Variant, Size, and Task Type in Arabic Pre-trained   Language Models","In this paper, we explore the effects of language variants, data sizes, and fine-tuning task types in Arabic pre-trained language models. To do so, we build three pre-trained language models across three variants of Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic, and classical Arabic, in addition to a fourth language model which is pre-trained on a mix of the three. We also examine the importance of pre-training data size by building additional models that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant. We compare our different models to each other, as well as to eight publicly available models by fine-tuning them on five NLP tasks spanning 12 datasets. Our results suggest that the variant proximity of pre-training data to fine-tuning data is more important than the pre-training data size. We exploit this insight in defining an optimized system selection model for the studied tasks."
Unsupervised Transfer Learning in Multilingual Neural Machine   Translation with Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings,"In this work we look into adding a new language to a multilingual NMT system in an unsupervised fashion. Under the utilization of pre-trained cross-lingual word embeddings we seek to exploit a language independent multilingual sentence representation to easily generalize to a new language. While using cross-lingual embeddings for word lookup we decode from a yet entirely unseen source language in a process we call blind decoding. Blindly decoding from Portuguese using a basesystem containing several Romance languages we achieve scores of 36.4 BLEU for Portuguese-English and 12.8 BLEU for Russian-English. In an attempt to train the mapping from the encoder sentence representation to a new target language we use our model as an autoencoder. Merely training to translate from Portuguese to Portuguese while freezing the encoder we achieve 26 BLEU on English-Portuguese, and up to 28 BLEU when adding artificial noise to the input. Lastly we explore a more practical adaptation approach through non-iterative backtranslation, exploiting our model's ability to produce high quality translations through blind decoding. This yields us up to 34.6 BLEU on English-Portuguese, attaining near parity with a model adapted on real bilingual data."
MERMAID: Metaphor Generation with Symbolism and Discriminative Decoding,"Generating metaphors is a challenging task as it requires a proper understanding of abstract concepts, making connections between unrelated concepts, and deviating from the literal meaning. In this paper, we aim to generate a metaphoric sentence given a literal expression by replacing relevant verbs. Based on a theoretically-grounded connection between metaphors and symbols, we propose a method to automatically construct a parallel corpus by transforming a large number of metaphorical sentences from the Gutenberg Poetry corpus (Jacobs, 2018) to their literal counterpart using recent advances in masked language modeling coupled with commonsense inference. For the generation task, we incorporate a metaphor discriminator to guide the decoding of a sequence to sequence model fine-tuned on our parallel data to generate high-quality metaphors. Human evaluation on an independent test set of literal statements shows that our best model generates metaphors better than three well-crafted baselines 66% of the time on average. A task-based evaluation shows that human-written poems enhanced with metaphors proposed by our model are preferred 68% of the time compared to poems without metaphors."
Towards Continual Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation via   Vocabulary Substitution,"We propose a straightforward vocabulary adaptation scheme to extend the language capacity of multilingual machine translation models, paving the way towards efficient continual learning for multilingual machine translation. Our approach is suitable for large-scale datasets, applies to distant languages with unseen scripts, incurs only minor degradation on the translation performance for the original language pairs and provides competitive performance even in the case where we only possess monolingual data for the new languages."
Evaluation of Morphological Embeddings for English and Russian Languages,"This paper evaluates morphology-based embeddings for English and Russian languages. Despite the interest and introduction of several morphology-based word embedding models in the past and acclaimed performance improvements on word similarity and language modeling tasks, in our experiments, we did not observe any stable preference over two of our baseline models - SkipGram and FastText. The performance exhibited by morphological embeddings is the average of the two baselines mentioned above."
Anaphoric Binding: an integrated overview,"The interpretation of anaphors depends on their antecedents as the semantic value that an anaphor eventually conveys is co-specified by the value of its antecedent. Interestingly, when occurring in a given syntactic position, different anaphors may have different sets of admissible antecedents. Such differences are the basis for the categorization of anaphoric expressions according to their anaphoric capacity, being important to determine what are the sets of admissible antecedents and how to represent and process this anaphoric capacity for each type of anaphor.   From an empirical perspective, these constraints stem from what appears as quite cogent generalisations and exhibit a universal character, given their cross linguistic validity. From a conceptual point of view, in turn, the relations among binding constraints involve non-trivial cross symmetry, which lends them a modular nature and provides further strength to the plausibility of their universal character. This kind of anaphoric binding constraints appears thus as a most significant subset of natural language knowledge, usually referred to as binding theory.   This paper provides an integrated overview of these constraints holding on the pairing of nominal anaphors with their admissible antecedents that are based on grammatical relations and structure. Along with the increasing interest on neuro-symbolic approaches to natural language, this paper seeks to contribute to revive the interest on this most intriguing research topic."
Preregistering NLP Research,"Preregistration refers to the practice of specifying what you are going to do, and what you expect to find in your study, before carrying out the study. This practice is increasingly common in medicine and psychology, but is rarely discussed in NLP. This paper discusses preregistration in more detail, explores how NLP researchers could preregister their work, and presents several preregistration questions for different kinds of studies. Finally, we argue in favour of registered reports, which could provide firmer grounds for slow science in NLP research. The goal of this paper is to elicit a discussion in the NLP community, which we hope to synthesise into a general NLP preregistration form in future research."
Learning Policies for Multilingual Training of Neural Machine   Translation Systems,"Low-resource Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) is typically tasked with improving the translation performance on one or more language pairs with the aid of high-resource language pairs. In this paper, we propose two simple search based curricula -- orderings of the multilingual training data -- which help improve translation performance in conjunction with existing techniques such as fine-tuning. Additionally, we attempt to learn a curriculum for MNMT from scratch jointly with the training of the translation system with the aid of contextual multi-arm bandits. We show on the FLORES low-resource translation dataset that these learned curricula can provide better starting points for fine tuning and improve overall performance of the translation system."
Learning Feature Weights using Reward Modeling for Denoising Parallel   Corpora,"Large web-crawled corpora represent an excellent resource for improving the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems across several language pairs. However, since these corpora are typically extremely noisy, their use is fairly limited. Current approaches to dealing with this problem mainly focus on filtering using heuristics or single features such as language model scores or bi-lingual similarity. This work presents an alternative approach which learns weights for multiple sentence-level features. These feature weights which are optimized directly for the task of improving translation performance, are used to score and filter sentences in the noisy corpora more effectively. We provide results of applying this technique to building NMT systems using the Paracrawl corpus for Estonian-English and show that it beats strong single feature baselines and hand designed combinations. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this method to different types of noise and explore if the learned weights generalize to other language pairs using the Maltese-English Paracrawl corpus."
Inductive Relation Prediction by BERT,"Relation prediction in knowledge graphs is dominated by embedding based methods which mainly focus on the transductive setting. Unfortunately, they are not able to handle inductive learning where unseen entities and relations are present and cannot take advantage of prior knowledge. Furthermore, their inference process is not easily explainable. In this work, we propose an all-in-one solution, called BERTRL (BERT-based Relational Learning), which leverages pre-trained language model and fine-tunes it by taking relation instances and their possible reasoning paths as training samples. BERTRL outperforms the SOTAs in 15 out of 18 cases in both inductive and transductive settings. Meanwhile, it demonstrates strong generalization capability in few-shot learning and is explainable."
Constrained Text Generation with Global Guidance -- Case Study on   CommonGen,"This paper studies constrained text generation, which is to generate sentences under certain pre-conditions. We focus on CommonGen, the task of generating text based on a set of concepts, as a representative task of constrained text generation. Traditional methods mainly rely on supervised training to maximize the likelihood of target sentences.However, global constraints such as common sense and coverage cannot be incorporated into the likelihood objective of the autoregressive decoding process. In this paper, we consider using reinforcement learning to address the limitation, measuring global constraints including fluency, common sense and concept coverage with a comprehensive score, which serves as the reward for reinforcement learning. Besides, we design a guided decoding method at the word, fragment and sentence levels. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly increases the concept coverage and outperforms existing models in various automatic evaluations."
Are NLP Models really able to Solve Simple Math Word Problems?,"The problem of designing NLP solvers for math word problems (MWP) has seen sustained research activity and steady gains in the test accuracy. Since existing solvers achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets for elementary level MWPs containing one-unknown arithmetic word problems, such problems are often considered ""solved"" with the bulk of research attention moving to more complex MWPs. In this paper, we restrict our attention to English MWPs taught in grades four and lower. We provide strong evidence that the existing MWP solvers rely on shallow heuristics to achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets. To this end, we show that MWP solvers that do not have access to the question asked in the MWP can still solve a large fraction of MWPs. Similarly, models that treat MWPs as bag-of-words can also achieve surprisingly high accuracy. Further, we introduce a challenge dataset, SVAMP, created by applying carefully chosen variations over examples sampled from existing datasets. The best accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art models is substantially lower on SVAMP, thus showing that much remains to be done even for the simplest of the MWPs."
Automatic Romanization of Arabic Bibliographic Records,"International library standards require cataloguers to tediously input Romanization of their catalogue records for the benefit of library users without specific language expertise. In this paper, we present the first reported results on the task of automatic Romanization of undiacritized Arabic bibliographic entries. This complex task requires the modeling of Arabic phonology, morphology, and even semantics. We collected a 2.5M word corpus of parallel Arabic and Romanized bibliographic entries, and benchmarked a number of models that vary in terms of complexity and resource dependence. Our best system reaches 89.3% exact word Romanization on a blind test set. We make our data and code publicly available."
Explaining and Improving BERT Performance on Lexical Semantic Change   Detection,"Type- and token-based embedding architectures are still competing in lexical semantic change detection. The recent success of type-based models in SemEval-2020 Task 1 has raised the question why the success of token-based models on a variety of other NLP tasks does not translate to our field. We investigate the influence of a range of variables on clusterings of BERT vectors and show that its low performance is largely due to orthographic information on the target word, which is encoded even in the higher layers of BERT representations. By reducing the influence of orthography we considerably improve BERT's performance."
A Simple Post-Processing Technique for Improving Readability Assessment   of Texts using Word Mover's Distance,"Assessing the proper difficulty levels of reading materials or texts in general is the first step towards effective comprehension and learning. In this study, we improve the conventional methodology of automatic readability assessment by incorporating the Word Mover's Distance (WMD) of ranked texts as an additional post-processing technique to further ground the difficulty level given by a model. Results of our experiments on three multilingual datasets in Filipino, German, and English show that the post-processing technique outperforms previous vanilla and ranking-based models using SVM."
Visual Cues and Error Correction for Translation Robustness,"Neural Machine Translation models are sensitive to noise in the input texts, such as misspelled words and ungrammatical constructions. Existing robustness techniques generally fail when faced with unseen types of noise and their performance degrades on clean texts. In this paper, we focus on three types of realistic noise that are commonly generated by humans and introduce the idea of visual context to improve translation robustness for noisy texts. In addition, we describe a novel error correction training regime that can be used as an auxiliary task to further improve translation robustness. Experiments on English-French and English-German translation show that both multimodal and error correction components improve model robustness to noisy texts, while still retaining translation quality on clean texts."
"Few-Shot Text Classification with Triplet Networks, Data Augmentation,   and Curriculum Learning","Few-shot text classification is a fundamental NLP task in which a model aims to classify text into a large number of categories, given only a few training examples per category. This paper explores data augmentation -- a technique particularly suitable for training with limited data -- for this few-shot, highly-multiclass text classification setting. On four diverse text classification tasks, we find that common data augmentation techniques can improve the performance of triplet networks by up to 3.0% on average.   To further boost performance, we present a simple training strategy called curriculum data augmentation, which leverages curriculum learning by first training on only original examples and then introducing augmented data as training progresses. We explore a two-stage and a gradual schedule, and find that, compared with standard single-stage training, curriculum data augmentation trains faster, improves performance, and remains robust to high amounts of noising from augmentation."
Improving Diversity of Neural Text Generation via Inverse Probability   Weighting,"The neural text generation suffers from the text degeneration issue such as repetition. Traditional stochastic sampling methods only focus on truncating the unreliable ""tail"" of the distribution, and do not address the ""head"" part, which we show might contain tedious or even repetitive candidates with high probability that lead to repetition loops. They also do not consider the issue that human text does not always favor high-probability words. Inspired by these, in this work we propose a heuristic sampling method. We propose to use interquartile range of the predicted distribution to determine the ""head"" part, then permutate and rescale the ""head"" with inverse probability. This aims at decreasing the probability for the tedious and possibly repetitive candidates with higher probability, and increasing the probability for the rational but more surprising candidates with lower probability. The proposed algorithm provides a reasonable permutation on the predicted distribution which enhances diversity without compromising rationality of the distribution. We use pre-trained language model to compare our algorithm with traditional methods. Results show that our algorithm can effectively increase the diversity of generated samples while achieving close resemblance to human text."
Bidirectional Machine Reading Comprehension for Aspect Sentiment Triplet   Extraction,"Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE), which aims to identify aspects from review sentences along with their corresponding opinion expressions and sentiments, is an emerging task in fine-grained opinion mining. Since ASTE consists of multiple subtasks, including opinion entity extraction, relation detection, and sentiment classification, it is critical and challenging to appropriately capture and utilize the associations among them. In this paper, we transform ASTE task into a multi-turn machine reading comprehension (MTMRC) task and propose a bidirectional MRC (BMRC) framework to address this challenge. Specifically, we devise three types of queries, including non-restrictive extraction queries, restrictive extraction queries and sentiment classification queries, to build the associations among different subtasks. Furthermore, considering that an aspect sentiment triplet can derive from either an aspect or an opinion expression, we design a bidirectional MRC structure. One direction sequentially recognizes aspects, opinion expressions, and sentiments to obtain triplets, while the other direction identifies opinion expressions first, then aspects, and at last sentiments. By making the two directions complement each other, our framework can identify triplets more comprehensively. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that BMRC achieves state-of-the-art performances."
Context Transformer with Stacked Pointer Networks for Conversational   Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs,"Neural semantic parsing approaches have been widely used for Question Answering (QA) systems over knowledge graphs. Such methods provide the flexibility to handle QA datasets with complex queries and a large number of entities. In this work, we propose a novel framework named CARTON, which performs multi-task semantic parsing for handling the problem of conversational question answering over a large-scale knowledge graph. Our framework consists of a stack of pointer networks as an extension of a context transformer model for parsing the input question and the dialog history. The framework generates a sequence of actions that can be executed on the knowledge graph. We evaluate CARTON on a standard dataset for complex sequential question answering on which CARTON outperforms all baselines. Specifically, we observe performance improvements in F1-score on eight out of ten question types compared to the previous state of the art. For logical reasoning questions, an improvement of 11 absolute points is reached."
ParaQA: A Question Answering Dataset with Paraphrase Responses for   Single-Turn Conversation,"This paper presents ParaQA, a question answering (QA) dataset with multiple paraphrased responses for single-turn conversation over knowledge graphs (KG). The dataset was created using a semi-automated framework for generating diverse paraphrasing of the answers using techniques such as back-translation. The existing datasets for conversational question answering over KGs (single-turn/multi-turn) focus on question paraphrasing and provide only up to one answer verbalization. However, ParaQA contains 5000 question-answer pairs with a minimum of two and a maximum of eight unique paraphrased responses for each question. We complement the dataset with baseline models and illustrate the advantage of having multiple paraphrased answers through commonly used metrics such as BLEU and METEOR. The ParaQA dataset is publicly available on a persistent URI for broader usage and adaptation in the research community."
Deep Discourse Analysis for Generating Personalized Feedback in   Intelligent Tutor Systems,"We explore creating automated, personalized feedback in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Our goal is to pinpoint correct and incorrect concepts in student answers in order to achieve better student learning gains. Although automatic methods for providing personalized feedback exist, they do not explicitly inform students about which concepts in their answers are correct or incorrect. Our approach involves decomposing students answers using neural discourse segmentation and classification techniques. This decomposition yields a relational graph over all discourse units covered by the reference solutions and student answers. We use this inferred relational graph structure and a neural classifier to match student answers with reference solutions and generate personalized feedback. Although the process is completely automated and data-driven, the personalized feedback generated is highly contextual, domain-aware and effectively targets each student's misconceptions and knowledge gaps. We test our method in a dialogue-based ITS and demonstrate that our approach results in high-quality feedback and significantly improved student learning gains."
SemVLP: Vision-Language Pre-training by Aligning Semantics at Multiple   Levels,"Vision-language pre-training (VLP) on large-scale image-text pairs has recently witnessed rapid progress for learning cross-modal representations. Existing pre-training methods either directly concatenate image representation and text representation at a feature level as input to a single-stream Transformer, or use a two-stream cross-modal Transformer to align the image-text representation at a high-level semantic space. In real-world image-text data, we observe that it is easy for some of the image-text pairs to align simple semantics on both modalities, while others may be related after higher-level abstraction. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new pre-training method SemVLP, which jointly aligns both the low-level and high-level semantics between image and text representations. The model is pre-trained iteratively with two prevalent fashions: single-stream pre-training to align at a fine-grained feature level and two-stream pre-training to align high-level semantics, by employing a shared Transformer network with a pluggable cross-modal attention module. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on four well-established vision-language understanding tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SemVLP in aligning cross-modal representations towards different semantic granularities."
"A `Sourceful' Twist: Emoji Prediction Based on Sentiment, Hashtags and   Application Source","We widely use emojis in social networking to heighten, mitigate or negate the sentiment of the text. Emoji suggestions already exist in many cross-platform applications but an emoji is predicted solely based a few prominent words instead of understanding the subject and substance of the text. Through this paper, we showcase the importance of using Twitter features to help the model understand the sentiment involved and hence to predict the most suitable emoji for the text. Hashtags and Application Sources like Android, etc. are two features which we found to be important yet underused in emoji prediction and Twitter sentiment analysis on the whole. To approach this shortcoming and to further understand emoji behavioral patterns, we propose a more balanced dataset by crawling additional Twitter data, including timestamp, hashtags, and application source acting as additional attributes to the tweet. Our data analysis and neural network model performance evaluations depict that using hashtags and application sources as features allows to encode different information and is effective in emoji prediction."
Learning a Word-Level Language Model with Sentence-Level Noise   Contrastive Estimation for Contextual Sentence Probability Estimation,"Inferring the probability distribution of sentences or word sequences is a key process in natural language processing. While word-level language models (LMs) have been widely adopted for computing the joint probabilities of word sequences, they have difficulty in capturing a context long enough for sentence probability estimation (SPE). To overcome this, recent studies introduced training methods using sentence-level noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this work, we attempt to extend it for contextual SPE, which aims to estimate a conditional sentence probability given a previous text. The proposed NCE samples negative sentences independently of a previous text so that the trained model gives higher probabilities to the sentences that are more consistent with \textcolor{blue}{the} context. We apply our method to a simple word-level RNN LM to focus on the effect of the sentence-level NCE training rather than on the network architecture. The quality of estimation was evaluated against multiple-choice cloze-style questions including both human and automatically generated questions. The experimental results show that the proposed method improved the SPE quality for the word-level RNN LM."
A Systematic Review of Reproducibility Research in Natural Language   Processing,"Against the background of what has been termed a reproducibility crisis in science, the NLP field is becoming increasingly interested in, and conscientious about, the reproducibility of its results. The past few years have seen an impressive range of new initiatives, events and active research in the area. However, the field is far from reaching a consensus about how reproducibility should be defined, measured and addressed, with diversity of views currently increasing rather than converging. With this focused contribution, we aim to provide a wide-angle, and as near as possible complete, snapshot of current work on reproducibility in NLP, delineating differences and similarities, and providing pointers to common denominators."
Generating CCG Categories,"Previous CCG supertaggers usually predict categories using multi-class classification. Despite their simplicity, internal structures of categories are usually ignored. The rich semantics inside these structures may help us to better handle relations among categories and bring more robustness into existing supertaggers. In this work, we propose to generate categories rather than classify them: each category is decomposed into a sequence of smaller atomic tags, and the tagger aims to generate the correct sequence. We show that with this finer view on categories, annotations of different categories could be shared and interactions with sentence contexts could be enhanced. The proposed category generator is able to achieve state-of-the-art tagging (95.5% accuracy) and parsing (89.8% labeled F1) performances on the standard CCGBank. Furthermore, its performances on infrequent (even unseen) categories, out-of-domain texts and low resource language give promising results on introducing generation models to the general CCG analyses."
Towards the evaluation of automatic simultaneous speech translation from   a communicative perspective,"In recent years, automatic speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation has gained momentum thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, especially in the domains of speech recognition and machine translation. The quality of such applications is commonly tested with automatic metrics, such as BLEU, primarily with the goal of assessing improvements of releases or in the context of evaluation campaigns. However, little is known about how the output of such systems is perceived by end users or how they compare to human performances in similar communicative tasks.   In this paper, we present the results of an experiment aimed at evaluating the quality of a real-time speech translation engine by comparing it to the performance of professional simultaneous interpreters. To do so, we adopt a framework developed for the assessment of human interpreters and use it to perform a manual evaluation on both human and machine performances. In our sample, we found better performance for the human interpreters in terms of intelligibility, while the machine performs slightly better in terms of informativeness. The limitations of the study and the possible enhancements of the chosen framework are discussed. Despite its intrinsic limitations, the use of this framework represents a first step towards a user-centric and communication-oriented methodology for evaluating real-time automatic speech translation."
NADI 2021: The Second Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification Shared Task,"We present the findings and results of the Second Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification Shared Task (NADI 2021). This Shared Task includes four subtasks: country-level Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) identification (Subtask 1.1), country-level dialect identification (Subtask 1.2), province-level MSA identification (Subtask 2.1), and province-level sub-dialect identification (Subtask 2.2). The shared task dataset covers a total of 100 provinces from 21 Arab countries, collected from the Twitter domain. A total of 53 teams from 23 countries registered to participate in the tasks, thus reflecting the interest of the community in this area. We received 16 submissions for Subtask 1.1 from five teams, 27 submissions for Subtask 1.2 from eight teams, 12 submissions for Subtask 2.1 from four teams, and 13 Submissions for subtask 2.2 from four teams."
Multi-view Subword Regularization,"Multilingual pretrained representations generally rely on subword segmentation algorithms to create a shared multilingual vocabulary. However, standard heuristic algorithms often lead to sub-optimal segmentation, especially for languages with limited amounts of data. In this paper, we take two major steps towards alleviating this problem. First, we demonstrate empirically that applying existing subword regularization methods(Kudo, 2018; Provilkov et al., 2020) during fine-tuning of pre-trained multilingual representations improves the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer. Second, to take full advantage of different possible input segmentations, we propose Multi-view Subword Regularization (MVR), a method that enforces the consistency between predictions of using inputs tokenized by the standard and probabilistic segmentations. Results on the XTREME multilingual benchmark(Hu et al., 2020) show that MVR brings consistent improvements of up to 2.5 points over using standard segmentation algorithms."
The Effect of Domain and Diacritics in Yorùbá-English Neural Machine   Translation,"Massively multilingual machine translation (MT) has shown impressive capabilities, including zero and few-shot translation between low-resource language pairs. However, these models are often evaluated on high-resource languages with the assumption that they generalize to low-resource ones. The difficulty of evaluating MT models on low-resource pairs is often due to lack of standardized evaluation datasets. In this paper, we present MENYO-20k, the first multi-domain parallel corpus with a special focus on clean orthography for Yor\`ub\'a--English with standardized train-test splits for benchmarking. We provide several neural MT benchmarks and compare them to the performance of popular pre-trained (massively multilingual) MT models both for the heterogeneous test set and its subdomains. Since these pre-trained models use huge amounts of data with uncertain quality, we also analyze the effect of diacritics, a major characteristic of Yor\`ub\'a, in the training data. We investigate how and when this training condition affects the final quality and intelligibility of a translation. Our models outperform massively multilingual models such as Google ($+8.7$ BLEU) and Facebook M2M ($+9.1$ BLEU) when translating to Yor\`ub\'a, setting a high quality benchmark for future research."
A Transition-based Parser for Unscoped Episodic Logical Forms,"""Episodic Logic:Unscoped Logical Form"" (EL-ULF) is a semantic representation capturing predicate-argument structure as well as more challenging aspects of language within the Episodic Logic formalism. We present the first learned approach for parsing sentences into ULFs, using a growing set of annotated examples. The results provide a strong baseline for future improvement. Our method learns a sequence-to-sequence model for predicting the transition action sequence within a modified cache transition system. We evaluate the efficacy of type grammar-based constraints, a word-to-symbol lexicon, and transition system state features in this task. Our system is available at https://github.com/genelkim/ulf-transition-parser We also present the first official annotated ULF dataset at https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/gkim21/ulf/resources/."
Robustly Optimized and Distilled Training for Natural Language   Understanding,"In this paper, we explore multi-task learning (MTL) as a second pretraining step to learn enhanced universal language representation for transformer language models. We use the MTL enhanced representation across several natural language understanding tasks to improve performance and generalization. Moreover, we incorporate knowledge distillation (KD) in MTL to further boost performance and devise a KD variant that learns effectively from multiple teachers. By combining MTL and KD, we propose Robustly Optimized and Distilled (ROaD) modeling framework. We use ROaD together with the ELECTRA model to obtain state-of-the-art results for machine reading comprehension and natural language inference."
Gumbel-Attention for Multi-modal Machine Translation,"Multi-modal machine translation (MMT) improves translation quality by introducing visual information. However, the existing MMT model ignores the problem that the image will bring information irrelevant to the text, causing much noise to the model and affecting the translation quality. This paper proposes a novel Gumbel-Attention for multi-modal machine translation, which selects the text-related parts of the image features. Specifically, different from the previous attention-based method, we first use a differentiable method to select the image information and automatically remove the useless parts of the image features. Experiments prove that our method retains the image features related to the text, and the remaining parts help the MMT model generates better translations."
Coordinate Constructions in English Enhanced Universal Dependencies:   Analysis and Computational Modeling,"In this paper, we address the representation of coordinate constructions in Enhanced Universal Dependencies (UD), where relevant dependency links are propagated from conjunction heads to other conjuncts. English treebanks for enhanced UD have been created from gold basic dependencies using a heuristic rule-based converter, which propagates only core arguments. With the aim of determining which set of links should be propagated from a semantic perspective, we create a large-scale dataset of manually edited syntax graphs. We identify several systematic errors in the original data, and propose to also propagate adjuncts. We observe high inter-annotator agreement for this semantic annotation task. Using our new manually verified dataset, we perform the first principled comparison of rule-based and (partially novel) machine-learning based methods for conjunction propagation for English. We show that learning propagation rules is more effective than hand-designing heuristic rules. When using automatic parses, our neural graph-parser based edge predictor outperforms the currently predominant pipelinesusing a basic-layer tree parser plus converters."
Structural Adapters in Pretrained Language Models for AMR-to-text   Generation,"Pretrained language models (PLM) have recently advanced graph-to-text generation, where the input graph is linearized into a sequence and fed into the PLM to obtain its representation. However, efficiently encoding the graph structure in PLMs is challenging because such models were pretrained on natural language, and modeling structured data may lead to catastrophic forgetting of distributional knowledge. In this paper, we propose StructAdapt, an adapter method to encode graph structure into PLMs. Contrary to prior work, StructAdapt effectively models interactions among the nodes based on the graph connectivity, only training graph structure-aware adapter parameters. In this way, we incorporate task-specific knowledge while maintaining the topological structure of the graph. We empirically show the benefits of explicitly encoding graph structure into PLMs using StructAdapt, outperforming the state of the art on two AMR-to-text datasets, training only 5.1% of the PLM parameters."
"No Intruder, no Validity: Evaluation Criteria for Privacy-Preserving   Text Anonymization","For sensitive text data to be shared among NLP researchers and practitioners, shared documents need to comply with data protection and privacy laws. There is hence a growing interest in automated approaches for text anonymization. However, measuring such methods' performance is challenging: missing a single identifying attribute can reveal an individual's identity. In this paper, we draw attention to this problem and argue that researchers and practitioners developing automated text anonymization systems should carefully assess whether their evaluation methods truly reflect the system's ability to protect individuals from being re-identified. We then propose TILD, a set of evaluation criteria that comprises an anonymization method's technical performance, the information loss resulting from its anonymization, and the human ability to de-anonymize redacted documents. These criteria may facilitate progress towards a standardized way for measuring anonymization performance."
Cross-Task Instance Representation Interactions and Label Dependencies   for Joint Information Extraction with Graph Convolutional Networks,"Existing works on information extraction (IE) have mainly solved the four main tasks separately (entity mention recognition, relation extraction, event trigger detection, and argument extraction), thus failing to benefit from inter-dependencies between tasks. This paper presents a novel deep learning model to simultaneously solve the four tasks of IE in a single model (called FourIE). Compared to few prior work on jointly performing four IE tasks, FourIE features two novel contributions to capture inter-dependencies between tasks. First, at the representation level, we introduce an interaction graph between instances of the four tasks that is used to enrich the prediction representation for one instance with those from related instances of other tasks. Second, at the label level, we propose a dependency graph for the information types in the four IE tasks that captures the connections between the types expressed in an input sentence. A new regularization mechanism is introduced to enforce the consistency between the golden and predicted type dependency graphs to improve representation learning. We show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for joint IE on both monolingual and multilingual learning settings with three different languages."
Dialogue History Matters! Personalized Response Selectionin Multi-turn   Retrieval-based Chatbots,"Existing multi-turn context-response matching methods mainly concentrate on obtaining multi-level and multi-dimension representations and better interactions between context utterances and response. However, in real-place conversation scenarios, whether a response candidate is suitable not only counts on the given dialogue context but also other backgrounds, e.g., wording habits, user-specific dialogue history content. To fill the gap between these up-to-date methods and the real-world applications, we incorporate user-specific dialogue history into the response selection and propose a personalized hybrid matching network (PHMN). Our contributions are two-fold: 1) our model extracts personalized wording behaviors from user-specific dialogue history as extra matching information; 2) we perform hybrid representation learning on context-response utterances and explicitly incorporate a customized attention mechanism to extract vital information from context-response interactions so as to improve the accuracy of matching. We evaluate our model on two large datasets with user identification, i.e., personalized Ubuntu dialogue Corpus (P-Ubuntu) and personalized Weibo dataset (P-Weibo). Experimental results confirm that our method significantly outperforms several strong models by combining personalized attention, wording behaviors, and hybrid representation learning."
