0,Are Classes Clusters?,"Sentence embedding models aim to provide general purpose embeddings for sentences. Most of the models studied in this paper claim to perform well on STS tasks - but they do not report on their suitability for clustering. This paper looks at four recent sentence embedding models (Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018), Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), LASER (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019), and DeCLUTR (Giorgi et al., 2020)). It gives a brief overview of the ideas behind their implementations. It then investigates how well topic classes in two text classification datasets (Amazon Reviews (Ni et al., 2019) and News Category Dataset (Misra, 2018)) map to clusters in their corresponding sentence embedding space. While the performance of the resulting classification model is far from perfect, it is better than random. This is interesting because the classification model has been constructed in an unsupervised way. The topic classes in these real life topic classification datasets can be partly reconstructed by clustering the corresponding sentence embeddings."
1,Multivalent Entailment Graphs for Question Answering,"Drawing inferences between open-domain natural language predicates is a necessity for true language understanding. There has been much progress in unsupervised learning of entailment graphs for this purpose. We make three contributions: (1) we reinterpret the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis to model entailment between predicates of different valencies, like DEFEAT(Biden, Trump) entails WIN(Biden); (2) we actualize this theory by learning unsupervised Multivalent Entailment Graphs of open-domain predicates; and (3) we demonstrate the capabilities of these graphs on a novel question answering task. We show that directional entailment is more helpful for inference than bidirectional similarity on questions of fine-grained semantics. We also show that drawing on evidence across valencies answers more questions than by using only the same valency evidence."
2,Comparison of Grammatical Error Correction Using Back-Translation Models,"Grammatical error correction (GEC) suffers from a lack of sufficient parallel data. Therefore, GEC studies have developed various methods to generate pseudo data, which comprise pairs of grammatical and artificially produced ungrammatical sentences. Currently, a mainstream approach to generate pseudo data is back-translation (BT). Most previous GEC studies using BT have employed the same architecture for both GEC and BT models. However, GEC models have different correction tendencies depending on their architectures. Thus, in this study, we compare the correction tendencies of the GEC models trained on pseudo data generated by different BT models, namely, Transformer, CNN, and LSTM. The results confirm that the correction tendencies for each error type are different for every BT model. Additionally, we examine the correction tendencies when using a combination of pseudo data generated by different BT models. As a result, we find that the combination of different BT models improves or interpolates the F_0.5 scores of each error type compared with that of single BT models with different seeds."
3,Segmenting Subtitles for Correcting ASR Segmentation Errors,"Typical ASR systems segment the input audio into utterances using purely acoustic information, which may not resemble the sentence-like units that are expected by conventional machine translation (MT) systems for Spoken Language Translation. In this work, we propose a model for correcting the acoustic segmentation of ASR models for low-resource languages to improve performance on downstream tasks. We propose the use of subtitles as a proxy dataset for correcting ASR acoustic segmentation, creating synthetic acoustic utterances by modeling common error modes. We train a neural tagging model for correcting ASR acoustic segmentation and show that it improves downstream performance on MT and audio-document cross-language information retrieval (CLIR)."
4,Probing Across Time: What Does RoBERTa Know and When?,"Models of language trained on very large corpora have been demonstrated useful for NLP. As fixed artifacts, they have become the object of intense study, with many researchers ""probing"" the extent to which linguistic abstractions, factual and commonsense knowledge, and reasoning abilities they acquire and readily demonstrate. Building on this line of work, we consider a new question: for types of knowledge a language model learns, when during (pre)training are they acquired? We plot probing performance across iterations, using RoBERTa as a case study. Among our findings: linguistic knowledge is acquired fast, stably, and robustly across domains. Facts and commonsense are slower and more domain-sensitive. Reasoning abilities are, in general, not stably acquired. As new datasets, pretraining protocols, and probes emerge, we believe that probing-across-time analyses can help researchers understand the complex, intermingled learning that these models undergo and guide us toward more efficient approaches that accomplish necessary learning faster."
5,A Comparative Study on Collecting High-Quality Implicit Reasonings at a   Large-scale,"Explicating implicit reasoning (i.e. warrants) in arguments is a long-standing challenge for natural language understanding systems. While recent approaches have focused on explicating warrants via crowdsourcing or expert annotations, the quality of warrants has been questionable due to the extreme complexity and subjectivity of the task. In this paper, we tackle the complex task of warrant explication and devise various methodologies for collecting warrants. We conduct an extensive study with trained experts to evaluate the resulting warrants of each methodology and find that our methodologies allow for high-quality warrants to be collected. We construct a preliminary dataset of 6,000 warrants annotated over 600 arguments for 3 debatable topics. To facilitate research in related downstream tasks, we release our guidelines and preliminary dataset."
6,Optimal Size-Performance Tradeoffs: Weighing PoS Tagger Models,"Improvement in machine learning-based NLP performance are often presented with bigger models and more complex code. This presents a trade-off: better scores come at the cost of larger tools; bigger models tend to require more during training and inference time. We present multiple methods for measuring the size of a model, and for comparing this with the model's performance.   In a case study over part-of-speech tagging, we then apply these techniques to taggers for eight languages and present a novel analysis identifying which taggers are size-performance optimal. Results indicate that some classical taggers place on the size-performance skyline across languages. Further, although the deep models have highest performance for multiple scores, it is often not the most complex of these that reach peak performance."
7,"ProphetNet-X: Large-Scale Pre-training Models for English, Chinese,   Multi-lingual, Dialog, and Code Generation","Now, the pre-training technique is ubiquitous in natural language processing field. ProphetNet is a pre-training based natural language generation method which shows powerful performance on English text summarization and question generation tasks. In this paper, we extend ProphetNet into other domains and languages, and present the ProphetNet family pre-training models, named ProphetNet-X, where X can be English, Chinese, Multi-lingual, and so on. We pre-train a cross-lingual generation model ProphetNet-Multi, a Chinese generation model ProphetNet-Zh, two open-domain dialog generation models ProphetNet-Dialog-En and ProphetNet-Dialog-Zh. And also, we provide a PLG (Programming Language Generation) model ProphetNet-Code to show the generation performance besides NLG (Natural Language Generation) tasks. In our experiments, ProphetNet-X models achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 10 benchmarks. All the models of ProphetNet-X share the same model structure, which allows users to easily switch between different models. We make the code and models publicly available, and we will keep updating more pre-training models and finetuning scripts."
8,Cost-effective End-to-end Information Extraction for Semi-structured   Document Images,"A real-world information extraction (IE) system for semi-structured document images often involves a long pipeline of multiple modules, whose complexity dramatically increases its development and maintenance cost. One can instead consider an end-to-end model that directly maps the input to the target output and simplify the entire process. However, such generation approach is known to lead to unstable performance if not designed carefully. Here we present our recent effort on transitioning from our existing pipeline-based IE system to an end-to-end system focusing on practical challenges that are associated with replacing and deploying the system in real, large-scale production. By carefully formulating document IE as a sequence generation task, we show that a single end-to-end IE system can be built and still achieve competent performance."
9,Improving Zero-Shot Multi-Lingual Entity Linking,"Entity linking -- the task of identifying references in free text to relevant knowledge base representations -- often focuses on single languages. We consider multilingual entity linking, where a single model is trained to link references to same-language knowledge bases in several languages. We propose a neural ranker architecture, which leverages multilingual transformer representations of text to be easily applied to a multilingual setting. We then explore how a neural ranker trained in one language (e.g. English) transfers to an unseen language (e.g. Chinese), and find that while there is a consistent but not large drop in performance. How can this drop in performance be alleviated? We explore adding an adversarial objective to force our model to learn language-invariant representations. We find that using this approach improves recall in several datasets, often matching the in-language performance, thus alleviating some of the performance loss occurring from zero-shot transfer."
10,LU-BZU at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Word2Vec and Lemma2Vec performance in   Arabic Word-in-Context disambiguation,"This paper presents a set of experiments to evaluate and compare between the performance of using CBOW Word2Vec and Lemma2Vec models for Arabic Word-in-Context (WiC) disambiguation without using sense inventories or sense embeddings. As part of the SemEval-2021 Shared Task 2 on WiC disambiguation, we used the dev.ar-ar dataset (2k sentence pairs) to decide whether two words in a given sentence pair carry the same meaning. We used two Word2Vec models: Wiki-CBOW, a pre-trained model on Arabic Wikipedia, and another model we trained on large Arabic corpora of about 3 billion tokens. Two Lemma2Vec models was also constructed based on the two Word2Vec models. Each of the four models was then used in the WiC disambiguation task, and then evaluated on the SemEval-2021 test.ar-ar dataset. At the end, we reported the performance of different models and compared between using lemma-based and word-based models."
11,Temporal Adaptation of BERT and Performance on Downstream Document   Classification: Insights from Social Media,"Language use differs between domains and even within a domain, language use changes over time. For pre-trained language models like BERT, domain adaptation through continued pre-training has been shown to improve performance on in-domain downstream tasks. In this article, we investigate whether temporal adaptation can bring additional benefits. For this purpose, we introduce a corpus of social media comments sampled over three years. It contains unlabelled data for adaptation and evaluation on an upstream masked language modelling task as well as labelled data for fine-tuning and evaluation on a downstream document classification task. We find that temporality matters for both tasks: temporal adaptation improves upstream and temporal fine-tuning downstream task performance. Time-specific models generally perform better on past than on future test sets, which matches evidence on the bursty usage of topical words. However, adapting BERT to time and domain does not improve performance on the downstream task over only adapting to domain. Token-level analysis shows that temporal adaptation captures event-driven changes in language use in the downstream task, but not those changes that are actually relevant to task performance. Based on our findings, we discuss when temporal adaptation may be more effective."
12,Towards Variable-Length Textual Adversarial Attacks,"Adversarial attacks have shown the vulnerability of machine learning models, however, it is non-trivial to conduct textual adversarial attacks on natural language processing tasks due to the discreteness of data. Most previous approaches conduct attacks with the atomic \textit{replacement} operation, which usually leads to fixed-length adversarial examples and therefore limits the exploration on the decision space. In this paper, we propose variable-length textual adversarial attacks~(VL-Attack) and integrate three atomic operations, namely \textit{insertion}, \textit{deletion} and \textit{replacement}, into a unified framework, by introducing and manipulating a special \textit{blank} token while attacking. In this way, our approach is able to more comprehensively find adversarial examples around the decision boundary and effectively conduct adversarial attacks. Specifically, our method drops the accuracy of IMDB classification by $96\%$ with only editing $1.3\%$ tokens while attacking a pre-trained BERT model. In addition, fine-tuning the victim model with generated adversarial samples can improve the robustness of the model without hurting the performance, especially for length-sensitive models. On the task of non-autoregressive machine translation, our method can achieve $33.18$ BLEU score on IWSLT14 German-English translation, achieving an improvement of $1.47$ over the baseline model."
13,"Back to Square One: Artifact Detection, Training and Commonsense   Disentanglement in the Winograd Schema","The Winograd Schema (WS) has been proposed as a test for measuring commonsense capabilities of models. Recently, pre-trained language model-based approaches have boosted performance on some WS benchmarks but the source of improvement is still not clear. This paper suggests that the apparent progress on WS may not necessarily reflect progress in commonsense reasoning. To support this claim, we first show that the current evaluation method of WS is sub-optimal and propose a modification that uses twin sentences for evaluation. We also propose two new baselines that indicate the existence of artifacts in WS benchmarks. We then develop a method for evaluating WS-like sentences in a zero-shot setting to account for the commonsense reasoning abilities acquired during the pretraining and observe that popular language models perform randomly in this setting when using our more strict evaluation. We conclude that the observed progress is mostly due to the use of supervision in training WS models, which is not likely to successfully support all the required commonsense reasoning skills and knowledge."
14,Word2rate: training and evaluating multiple word embeddings as   statistical transitions,"Using pretrained word embeddings has been shown to be a very effective way in improving the performance of natural language processing tasks. In fact almost any natural language tasks that can be thought of has been improved by these pretrained embeddings. These tasks range from sentiment analysis, translation, sequence prediction amongst many others. One of the most successful word embeddings is the Word2vec CBOW model proposed by Mikolov trained by the negative sampling technique. Mai et al. modifies this objective to train CMOW embeddings that are sensitive to word order. We used a modified version of the negative sampling objective for our context words, modelling the context embeddings as a Taylor series of rate matrices. We show that different modes of the Taylor series produce different types of embeddings. We compare these embeddings to their similar counterparts like CBOW and CMOW and show that they achieve comparable performance. We also introduce a novel left-right context split objective that improves performance for tasks sensitive to word order. Our Word2rate model is grounded in a statistical foundation using rate matrices while being competitive in variety of language tasks."
15,IndoNLG: Benchmark and Resources for Evaluating Indonesian Natural   Language Generation,"Natural language generation (NLG) benchmarks provide an important avenue to measure progress and develop better NLG systems. Unfortunately, the lack of publicly available NLG benchmarks for low-resource languages poses a challenging barrier for building NLG systems that work well for languages with limited amounts of data. Here we introduce IndoNLG, the first benchmark to measure natural language generation (NLG) progress in three low-resource -- yet widely spoken -- languages of Indonesia: Indonesian, Javanese, and Sundanese. Altogether, these languages are spoken by more than 100 million native speakers, and hence constitute an important use case of NLG systems today. Concretely, IndoNLG covers six tasks: summarization, question answering, chit-chat, and three different pairs of machine translation (MT) tasks. We collate a clean pretraining corpus of Indonesian, Sundanese, and Javanese datasets, Indo4B-Plus, which is used to pretrain our models: IndoBART and IndoGPT. We show that IndoBART and IndoGPT achieve competitive performance on all tasks -- despite using only one-fifth the parameters of a larger multilingual model, mBART-LARGE (Liu et al., 2020). This finding emphasizes the importance of pretraining on closely related, local languages to achieve more efficient learning and faster inference for very low-resource languages like Javanese and Sundanese."
16,$Q^{2}$: Evaluating Factual Consistency in Knowledge-Grounded Dialogues   via Question Generation and Question Answering,"Neural knowledge-grounded generative models for dialogue often produce content that is factually inconsistent with the knowledge they rely on, making them unreliable and limiting their applicability. Inspired by recent work on evaluating factual consistency in abstractive summarization, we propose an automatic evaluation metric for factual consistency in knowledge-grounded dialogue using automatic question generation and question answering. Our metric, denoted $Q^2$, compares answer spans using natural language inference (NLI), instead of token-based matching as done in previous work. To foster proper evaluation, we curate a novel dataset of dialogue system outputs for the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset, manually annotated for factual consistency. We perform a thorough meta-evaluation of $Q^2$ against other metrics using this dataset and two others, where it consistently shows higher correlation with human judgements."
17,Robust Open-Vocabulary Translation from Visual Text Representations,"Machine translation models have discrete vocabularies and commonly use subword segmentation techniques to achieve an 'open vocabulary.' This approach relies on consistent and correct underlying unicode sequences, and makes models susceptible to degradation from common types of noise and variation. Motivated by the robustness of human language processing, we propose the use of visual text representations, which dispense with a finite set of text embeddings in favor of continuous vocabularies created by processing visually rendered text with sliding windows. We show that models using visual text representations approach or match performance of traditional text models on small and larger datasets. More importantly, models with visual embeddings demonstrate significant robustness to varied types of noise, achieving e.g., 25.9 BLEU on a character permuted German-English task where subword models degrade to 1.9."
18,Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction with Sentence Reconstruction   and Knowledge Base Priors,"We propose a multi-task, probabilistic approach to facilitate distantly supervised relation extraction by bringing closer the representations of sentences that contain the same Knowledge Base pairs. To achieve this, we bias the latent space of sentences via a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that is trained jointly with a relation classifier. The latent code guides the pair representations and influences sentence reconstruction. Experimental results on two datasets created via distant supervision indicate that multi-task learning results in performance benefits. Additional exploration of employing Knowledge Base priors into the VAE reveals that the sentence space can be shifted towards that of the Knowledge Base, offering interpretability and further improving results."
19,An Adversarially-Learned Turing Test for Dialog Generation Models,"The design of better automated dialogue evaluation metrics offers the potential of accelerate evaluation research on conversational AI. However, existing trainable dialogue evaluation models are generally restricted to classifiers trained in a purely supervised manner, which suffer a significant risk from adversarial attacking (e.g., a nonsensical response that enjoys a high classification score). To alleviate this risk, we propose an adversarial training approach to learn a robust model, ATT (Adversarial Turing Test), that discriminates machine-generated responses from human-written replies. In contrast to previous perturbation-based methods, our discriminator is trained by iteratively generating unrestricted and diverse adversarial examples using reinforcement learning. The key benefit of this unrestricted adversarial training approach is allowing the discriminator to improve robustness in an iterative attack-defense game. Our discriminator shows high accuracy on strong attackers including DialoGPT and GPT-3."
20,What to Pre-Train on? Efficient Intermediate Task Selection,"Intermediate task fine-tuning has been shown to culminate in large transfer gains across many NLP tasks. With an abundance of candidate datasets as well as pre-trained language models, it has become infeasible to run the cross-product of all combinations to find the best transfer setting. In this work we first establish that similar sequential fine-tuning gains can be achieved in adapter settings, and subsequently consolidate previously proposed methods that efficiently identify beneficial tasks for intermediate transfer learning. We experiment with a diverse set of 42 intermediate and 11 target English classification, multiple choice, question answering, and sequence tagging tasks. Our results show that efficient embedding based methods that rely solely on the respective datasets outperform computational expensive few-shot fine-tuning approaches. Our best methods achieve an average Regret@3 of less than 1% across all target tasks, demonstrating that we are able to efficiently identify the best datasets for intermediate training."
21,proScript: Partially Ordered Scripts Generation via Pre-trained Language   Models,"Scripts - standardized event sequences describing typical everyday activities - have been shown to help understand narratives by providing expectations, resolving ambiguity, and filling in unstated information. However, to date they have proved hard to author or extract from text. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that pre-trained neural language models (LMs) can be be finetuned to generate high-quality scripts, at varying levels of granularity, for a wide range of everyday scenarios (e.g., bake a cake). To do this, we collected a large (6.4k), crowdsourced partially ordered scripts (named proScript), which is substantially larger than prior datasets, and developed models that generate scripts with combining language generation and structure prediction. We define two complementary tasks: (i) edge prediction: given a scenario and unordered events, organize the events into a valid (possibly partial-order) script, and (ii) script generation: given only a scenario, generate events and organize them into a (possibly partial-order) script. Our experiments show that our models perform well (e.g., F1=75.7 in task (i)), illustrating a new approach to overcoming previous barriers to script collection. We also show that there is still significant room for improvement toward human level performance. Together, our tasks, dataset, and models offer a new research direction for learning script knowledge."
22,Context-Adaptive Document-Level Neural Machine Translation,"Most existing document-level neural machine translation (NMT) models leverage a fixed number of the previous or all global source sentences to handle the context-independent problem in standard NMT. However, the translating of each source sentence benefits from various sizes of context, and inappropriate context may harm the translation performance. In this work, we introduce a data-adaptive method that enables the model to adopt the necessary and useful context. Specifically, we introduce a light predictor into two document-level translation models to select the explicit context. Experiments demonstrate the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance over the previous methods with a gain up to 1.99 BLEU points."
23,Learning to Reason for Text Generation from Scientific Tables,"In this paper, we introduce SciGen, a new challenge dataset for the task of reasoning-aware data-to-text generation consisting of tables from scientific articles and their corresponding descriptions. Describing scientific tables goes beyond the surface realization of the table content and requires reasoning over table values. The unique properties of SciGen are that (1) tables mostly contain numerical values, and (2) the corresponding descriptions require arithmetic reasoning. SciGen is therefore the first dataset that assesses the arithmetic reasoning capabilities of generation models on complex input structures, i.e., tables from scientific articles. We study the effectiveness of state-of-the-art data-to-text generation models on SciGen and evaluate the results using common metrics as well as human evaluation. Our results and analyses show that (a) while humans like to reason for describing scientific tables, the ability of state-of-the-art models is severely limited on this task, (b) while adding more training data improves the results, it is not the solution for reasoning-aware text generation, and (c) one of the main bottlenecks for this task is the lack of proper automatic evaluation metrics. The data, code, and annotations for human evaluation will be available at https://github.com/UKPLab/SciGen. SciGen opens new avenues for future research in reasoning-aware text generation and evaluation."
24,Membership Inference Attack Susceptibility of Clinical Language Models,"Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have been shown to have high empirical privacy leakages. Clinical language models (CLMs) trained on clinical data have been used to improve performance in biomedical natural language processing tasks. In this work, we investigate the risks of training-data leakage through white-box or black-box access to CLMs. We design and employ membership inference attacks to estimate the empirical privacy leaks for model architectures like BERT and GPT2. We show that membership inference attacks on CLMs lead to non-trivial privacy leakages of up to 7%. Our results show that smaller models have lower empirical privacy leakages than larger ones, and masked LMs have lower leakages than auto-regressive LMs. We further show that differentially private CLMs can have improved model utility on clinical domain while ensuring low empirical privacy leakage. Lastly, we also study the effects of group-level membership inference and disease rarity on CLM privacy leakages."
25,Surface Form Competition: Why the Highest Probability Answer Isn't   Always Right,"Large language models have shown promising results in zero-shot settings (Brown et al.,2020; Radford et al., 2019). For example, they can perform multiple choice tasks simply by conditioning on a question and selecting the answer with the highest probability.   However, ranking by string probability can be problematic due to surface form competition-wherein different surface forms compete for probability mass, even if they represent the same underlying concept, e.g. ""computer"" and ""PC."" Since probability mass is finite, this lowers the probability of the correct answer, due to competition from other strings that are valid answers (but not one of the multiple choice options).   We introduce Domain Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information, an alternative scoring function that directly compensates for surface form competition by simply reweighing each option according to a term that is proportional to its a priori likelihood within the context of the specific zero-shot task. It achieves consistent gains in zero-shot performance over both calibrated (Zhao et al., 2021) and uncalibrated scoring functions on all GPT-2 and GPT-3 models over a variety of multiple choice datasets."
26,On the Importance of Effectively Adapting Pretrained Language Models for   Active Learning,"Recent Active Learning (AL) approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) proposed using off-the-shelf pretrained language models (LMs). In this paper, we argue that these LMs are not adapted effectively to the downstream task during AL and we explore ways to address this issue. We suggest to first adapt the pretrained LM to the target task by continuing training with all the available unlabeled data and then use it for AL. We also propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method to ensure that the adapted LM is properly trained in both low and high resource scenarios during AL. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach provides substantial data efficiency improvements compared to the standard fine-tuning approach, suggesting that a poor training strategy can be catastrophic for AL."
27,ESTER: A Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset for Event Semantic   Relation Reasoning,"Understanding how events are semantically related to each other is the essence of reading comprehension. Recent event-centric reading comprehension datasets focus mostly on event arguments or temporal relations. While these tasks partially evaluate machines' ability of narrative understanding, human-like reading comprehension requires the capability to process event-based information beyond arguments and temporal reasoning. For example, to understand causality between events, we need to infer motivation or purpose; to establish event hierarchy, we need to understand the composition of events. To facilitate these tasks, we introduce ESTER, a comprehensive machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset for Event Semantic Relation Reasoning. The dataset leverages natural language queries to reason about the five most common event semantic relations, provides more than 6K questions and captures 10.1K event relation pairs. Experimental results show that the current SOTA systems achieve 22.1%, 63.3%, and 83.5% for token-based exact-match, F1, and event-based HIT@1 scores, which are all significantly below human performances (36.0%, 79.6%, 100% respectively), highlighting our dataset as a challenging benchmark."
28,Concadia: Towards Image-Based Text Generation with a Purpose,"Current deep learning models often achieve excellent results on benchmark image-to-text datasets but fail to generate texts that are useful in practice. We argue that to close this gap, it is vital to distinguish descriptions from captions based on their distinct communicative roles. Descriptions focus on visual features and are meant to replace an image (often to increase accessibility), whereas captions appear alongside an image to supply additional information. To motivate this distinction and help people put it into practice, we introduce the publicly available Wikipedia-based dataset Concadia consisting of 96,918 images with corresponding English-language descriptions, captions, and surrounding context. Using insights from Concadia, models trained on it, and a preregistered human-subjects experiment with human- and model-generated texts, we characterize the commonalities and differences between descriptions and captions. In addition, we show that, for generating both descriptions and captions, it is useful to augment image-to-text models with representations of the textual context in which the image appeared."
29,Unsupervised Extractive Summarization by Human Memory Simulation,"Summarization systems face the core challenge of identifying and selecting important information. In this paper, we tackle the problem of content selection in unsupervised extractive summarization of long, structured documents. We introduce a wide range of heuristics that leverage cognitive representations of content units and how these are retained or forgotten in human memory. We find that properties of these representations of human memory can be exploited to capture relevance of content units in scientific articles. Experiments show that our proposed heuristics are effective at leveraging cognitive structures and the organization of the document (i.e.\ sections of an article), and automatic and human evaluations provide strong evidence that these heuristics extract more summary-worthy content units."
30,Re-TACRED: Addressing Shortcomings of the TACRED Dataset,"TACRED is one of the largest and most widely used sentence-level relation extraction datasets. Proposed models that are evaluated using this dataset consistently set new state-of-the-art performance. However, they still exhibit large error rates despite leveraging external knowledge and unsupervised pretraining on large text corpora. A recent study suggested that this may be due to poor dataset quality. The study observed that over 50% of the most challenging sentences from the development and test sets are incorrectly labeled and account for an average drop of 8% f1-score in model performance. However, this study was limited to a small biased sample of 5k (out of a total of 106k) sentences, substantially restricting the generalizability and broader implications of its findings. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by: (i) performing a comprehensive study over the whole TACRED dataset, (ii) proposing an improved crowdsourcing strategy and deploying it to re-annotate the whole dataset, and (iii) performing a thorough analysis to understand how correcting the TACRED annotations affects previously published results. After verification, we observed that 23.9% of TACRED labels are incorrect. Moreover, evaluating several models on our revised dataset yields an average f1-score improvement of 14.3% and helps uncover significant relationships between the different models (rather than simply offsetting or scaling their scores by a constant factor). Finally, aside from our analysis we also release Re-TACRED, a new completely re-annotated version of the TACRED dataset that can be used to perform reliable evaluation of relation extraction models."
31,Structure-Aware Abstractive Conversation Summarization via Discourse and   Action Graphs,"Abstractive conversation summarization has received much attention recently. However, these generated summaries often suffer from insufficient, redundant, or incorrect content, largely due to the unstructured and complex characteristics of human-human interactions. To this end, we propose to explicitly model the rich structures in conversations for more precise and accurate conversation summarization, by first incorporating discourse relations between utterances and action triples (""who-doing-what"") in utterances through structured graphs to better encode conversations, and then designing a multi-granularity decoder to generate summaries by combining all levels of information. Experiments show that our proposed models outperform state-of-the-art methods and generalize well in other domains in terms of both automatic evaluations and human judgments. We have publicly released our code at https://github.com/GT-SALT/Structure-Aware-BART."
32,Identifying the Limits of Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer for Pretrained   Models,"There is growing evidence that pretrained language models improve task-specific fine-tuning not just for the languages seen in pretraining, but also for new languages and even non-linguistic data. What is the nature of this surprising cross-domain transfer? We offer a partial answer via a systematic exploration of how much transfer occurs when models are denied any information about word identity via random scrambling. In four classification tasks and two sequence labeling tasks, we evaluate baseline models, LSTMs using GloVe embeddings, and BERT. We find that only BERT shows high rates of transfer into our scrambled domains, and for classification but not sequence labeling tasks. Our analyses seek to explain why transfer succeeds for some tasks but not others, to isolate the separate contributions of pretraining versus fine-tuning, and to quantify the role of word frequency. These findings help explain where and why cross-domain transfer occurs, which can guide future studies and practical fine-tuning efforts."
33,Sequential Cross-Document Coreference Resolution,"Relating entities and events in text is a key component of natural language understanding. Cross-document coreference resolution, in particular, is important for the growing interest in multi-document analysis tasks. In this work we propose a new model that extends the efficient sequential prediction paradigm for coreference resolution to cross-document settings and achieves competitive results for both entity and event coreference while provides strong evidence of the efficacy of both sequential models and higher-order inference in cross-document settings. Our model incrementally composes mentions into cluster representations and predicts links between a mention and the already constructed clusters, approximating a higher-order model. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation studies that provide new insights into the importance of various inputs and representation types in coreference."
34,A Full Text-Dependent End to End Mispronunciation Detection and   Diagnosis with Easy Data Augmentation Techniques,"Recently, end-to-end mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MD&D) systems has become a popular alternative to greatly simplify the model-building process of conventional hybrid DNN-HMM systems by representing complicated modules with a single deep network architecture. In this paper, in order to utilize the prior text in the end-to-end structure, we present a novel text-dependent model which is difference with sed-mdd, the model achieves a fully end-to-end system by aligning the audio with the phoneme sequences of the prior text inside the model through the attention mechanism. Moreover, the prior text as input will be a problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples in the phoneme sequence. To alleviate this problem, we propose three simple data augmentation methods, which effectively improve the ability of model to capture mispronounced phonemes. We conduct experiments on L2-ARCTIC, and our best performance improved from 49.29% to 56.08% in F-measure metric compared to the CNN-RNN-CTC model."
35,Three-level Hierarchical Transformer Networks for Long-sequence and   Multiple Clinical Documents Classification,"We present a Three-level Hierarchical Transformer Network (3-level-HTN) for modeling long-term dependencies across clinical notes for the purpose of patient-level prediction. The network is equipped with three levels of Transformer-based encoders to learn progressively from words to sentences, sentences to notes, and finally notes to patients. The first level from word to sentence directly applies a pre-trained BERT model as a fully trainable component. While the second and third levels both implement a stack of transformer-based encoders, before the final patient representation is fed into a classification layer for clinical predictions. Compared to conventional BERT models, our model increases the maximum input length from 512 tokens to much longer sequences that are appropriate for modeling large numbers of clinical notes. We empirically examine different hyper-parameters to identify an optimal trade-off given computational resource limits. Our experiment results on the MIMIC-III dataset for different prediction tasks demonstrate that the proposed Hierarchical Transformer Network outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including but not limited to BigBird."
36,Data Distillation for Text Classification,"Deep learning techniques have achieved great success in many fields, while at the same time deep learning models are getting more complex and expensive to compute. It severely hinders the wide applications of these models. In order to alleviate this problem, model distillation emerges as an effective means to compress a large model into a smaller one without a significant drop in accuracy. In this paper, we study a related but orthogonal issue, data distillation, which aims to distill the knowledge from a large training dataset down to a smaller and synthetic one. It has the potential to address the large and growing neural network training problem based on the small dataset. We develop a novel data distillation method for text classification. We evaluate our method on eight benchmark datasets. The results that the distilled data with the size of 0.1% of the original text data achieves approximately 90% performance of the original is rather impressive."
37,R&R: Metric-guided Adversarial Sentence Generation,"Adversarial examples are helpful for analyzing and improving the robustness of text classifiers. Generating high-quality adversarial examples is a challenging task as it requires generating fluent adversarial sentences that are semantically similar to the original sentences and preserve the original labels, while causing the classifier to misclassify them. Existing methods prioritize misclassification by maximizing each perturbation's effectiveness at misleading a text classifier; thus, the generated adversarial examples fall short in terms of fluency and similarity. In this paper, we propose a rewrite and rollback (R&R) framework for adversarial attack. It improves the quality of adversarial examples by optimizing a critique score which combines the fluency, similarity, and misclassification metrics. R&R generates high-quality adversarial examples by allowing exploration of perturbations that do not have immediate impact on the misclassification metric but can improve fluency and similarity metrics. We evaluate our method on 5 representative datasets and 3 classifier architectures. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art in attack success rate by +16.2%, +12.8%, and +14.0% on the classifiers respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/DAI-Lab/fibber"
38,Neural Path Hunter: Reducing Hallucination in Dialogue Systems via Path   Grounding,"Dialogue systems powered by large pre-trained language models (LM) exhibit an innate ability to deliver fluent and natural-looking responses. Despite their impressive generation performance, these models can often generate factually incorrect statements impeding their widespread adoption. In this paper, we focus on the task of improving the faithfulness -- and thus reduce hallucination -- of Neural Dialogue Systems to known facts supplied by a Knowledge Graph (KG). We propose Neural Path Hunter which follows a generate-then-refine strategy whereby a generated response is amended using the k-hop subgraph of a KG. Neural Path Hunter leverages a separate token-level fact critic to identify plausible sources of hallucination followed by a refinement stage consisting of a chain of two neural LM's that retrieves correct entities by crafting a query signal that is propagated over the k-hop subgraph. Our proposed model can easily be applied to any dialogue generated responses without retraining the model. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the OpenDialKG dataset against a suite of metrics and report a relative improvement of faithfulness over dialogue responses by 20.35% based on FeQA (Durmus et al., 2020)."
39,Moving on from OntoNotes: Coreference Resolution Model Transfer,"Academic neural models for coreference resolution (coref) are typically trained on a single dataset, OntoNotes, and model improvements are benchmarked on that same dataset. However, real-world applications of coref depend on the annotation guidelines and the domain of the target dataset, which often differ from those of OntoNotes. We aim to quantify transferability of coref models based on the number of annotated documents available in the target dataset. We examine eleven target datasets and find that continued training is consistently effective and especially beneficial when there are few target documents. We establish new benchmarks across several datasets, including state-of-the-art results on PreCo."
40,Syntactic structures and the general Markov models,"We study phylogenetic signal present in syntactic information by considering the syntactic structures data from Longobardi (2017b), Collins (2010), Ceolin et al. (2020) and Koopman (2011). Focusing first on the general Markov models, we explore how well the the syntactic structures data conform to the hypothesis required by these models. We do this by comparing derived phylogenetic trees against trees agreed on by the linguistics community. We then interpret the methods of Ceolin et al. (2020) as an infinite sites evolutionary model and compare the consistency of the data with this alternative. The ideas and methods discussed in the present paper are more generally applicable than to the specific setting of syntactic structures, and can be used in other contexts, when analyzing consistency of data with against hypothesized evolutionary models."
41,A multilabel approach to morphosyntactic probing,"We introduce a multilabel probing task to assess the morphosyntactic representations of word embeddings from multilingual language models. We demonstrate this task with multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), training probes for seven typologically diverse languages of varying morphological complexity: Afrikaans, Croatian, Finnish, Hebrew, Korean, Spanish, and Turkish. Through this simple but robust paradigm, we show that multilingual BERT renders many morphosyntactic features easily and simultaneously extractable (e.g., gender, grammatical case, pronominal type). We further evaluate the probes on six ""held-out"" languages in a zero-shot transfer setting: Arabic, Chinese, Marathi, Slovenian, Tagalog, and Yoruba. This style of probing has the added benefit of revealing the linguistic properties that language models recognize as being shared across languages. For instance, the probes performed well on recognizing nouns in the held-out languages, suggesting that multilingual BERT has a conception of noun-hood that transcends individual languages; yet, the same was not true of adjectives."
42,Frequency-based Distortions in Contextualized Word Embeddings,"How does word frequency in pre-training data affect the behavior of similarity metrics in contextualized BERT embeddings? Are there systematic ways in which some word relationships are exaggerated or understated? In this work, we explore the geometric characteristics of contextualized word embeddings with two novel tools: (1) an identity probe that predicts the identity of a word using its embedding; (2) the minimal bounding sphere for a word's contextualized representations. Our results reveal that words of high and low frequency differ significantly with respect to their representational geometry. Such differences introduce distortions: when compared to human judgments, point estimates of embedding similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) can over- or under-estimate the semantic similarity of two words, depending on the frequency of those words in the training data. This has downstream societal implications: BERT-Base has more trouble differentiating between South American and African countries than North American and European ones. We find that these distortions persist when using BERT-Multilingual, suggesting that they cannot be easily fixed with additional data, which in turn introduces new distortions."
43,Sentence Concatenation Approach to Data Augmentation for Neural Machine   Translation,"Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently gained widespread attention because of its high translation accuracy. However, it shows poor performance in the translation of long sentences, which is a major issue in low-resource languages. It is assumed that this issue is caused by insufficient number of long sentences in the training data. Therefore, this study proposes a simple data augmentation method to handle long sentences. In this method, we use only the given parallel corpora as the training data and generate long sentences by concatenating two sentences. Based on the experimental results, we confirm improvements in long sentence translation by the proposed data augmentation method, despite its simplicity. Moreover, the translation quality is further improved by the proposed method, when combined with back-translation."
44,Learning to Share by Masking the Non-shared for Multi-domain Sentiment   Classification,"Multi-domain sentiment classification deals with the scenario where labeled data exists for multiple domains but insufficient for training effective sentiment classifiers that work across domains. Thus, fully exploiting sentiment knowledge shared across domains is crucial for real world applications. While many existing works try to extract domain-invariant features in high-dimensional space, such models fail to explicitly distinguish between shared and private features at text-level, which to some extent lacks interpretablity. Based on the assumption that removing domain-related tokens from texts would help improve their domain-invariance, we instead first transform original sentences to be domain-agnostic. To this end, we propose the BertMasker network which explicitly masks domain-related words from texts, learns domain-invariant sentiment features from these domain-agnostic texts, and uses those masked words to form domain-aware sentence representations. Empirical experiments on a well-adopted multiple domain sentiment classification dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on both multi-domain sentiment classification and cross-domain settings, by increasing the accuracy by 0.94% and 1.8% respectively. Further analysis on masking proves that removing those domain-related and sentiment irrelevant tokens decreases texts' domain distinction, resulting in the performance degradation of a BERT-based domain classifier by over 12%."
45,Revisiting Few-shot Relation Classification: Evaluation Data and   Classification Schemes,"We explore Few-Shot Learning (FSL) for Relation Classification (RC). Focusing on the realistic scenario of FSL, in which a test instance might not belong to any of the target categories (none-of-the-above, aka NOTA), we first revisit the recent popular dataset structure for FSL, pointing out its unrealistic data distribution. To remedy this, we propose a novel methodology for deriving more realistic few-shot test data from available datasets for supervised RC, and apply it to the TACRED dataset. This yields a new challenging benchmark for FSL RC, on which state of the art models show poor performance. Next, we analyze classification schemes within the popular embedding-based nearest-neighbor approach for FSL, with respect to constraints they impose on the embedding space. Triggered by this analysis we propose a novel classification scheme, in which the NOTA category is represented as learned vectors, shown empirically to be an appealing option for FSL."
46,Minimal Supervision for Morphological Inflection,"Neural models for the various flavours of morphological inflection tasks have proven to be extremely accurate given ample labeled data -- data that may be slow and costly to obtain. In this work we aim to overcome this annotation bottleneck by bootstrapping labeled data from a seed as little as {\em five} labeled paradigms, accompanied by a large bulk of unlabeled text. Our approach exploits different kinds of regularities in morphological systems in a two-phased setup, where word tagging based on {\em analogies} is followed by word pairing based on {\em distances}. We experiment with the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem over eight typologically different languages, and find that, in languages with relatively simple morphology, orthographic regularities on their own allow inflection models to achieve respectable accuracy. Combined orthographic and semantic regularities alleviate difficulties with particularly complex morpho-phonological systems. Our results suggest that hand-crafting many tagged examples might be an unnecessary effort. However, more work is needed in order to address rarely used forms."
47,Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Intent Detection from Spoken Data,"We present a systematic study on multilingual and cross-lingual intent detection from spoken data. The study leverages a new resource put forth in this work, termed MInDS-14, a first training and evaluation resource for the intent detection task with spoken data. It covers 14 intents extracted from a commercial system in the e-banking domain, associated with spoken examples in 14 diverse language varieties. Our key results indicate that combining machine translation models with state-of-the-art multilingual sentence encoders (e.g., LaBSE) can yield strong intent detectors in the majority of target languages covered in MInDS-14, and offer comparative analyses across different axes: e.g., zero-shot versus few-shot learning, translation direction, and impact of speech recognition. We see this work as an important step towards more inclusive development and evaluation of multilingual intent detectors from spoken data, in a much wider spectrum of languages compared to prior work."
48,The Impact of ASR on the Automatic Analysis of Linguistic Complexity and   Sophistication in Spontaneous L2 Speech,"In recent years, automated approaches to assessing linguistic complexity in second language (L2) writing have made significant progress in gauging learner performance, predicting human ratings of the quality of learner productions, and benchmarking L2 development. In contrast, there is comparatively little work in the area of speaking, particularly with respect to fully automated approaches to assessing L2 spontaneous speech. While the importance of a well-performing ASR system is widely recognized, little research has been conducted to investigate the impact of its performance on subsequent automatic text analysis. In this paper, we focus on this issue and examine the impact of using a state-of-the-art ASR system for subsequent automatic analysis of linguistic complexity in spontaneously produced L2 speech. A set of 30 selected measures were considered, falling into four categories: syntactic, lexical, n-gram frequency, and information-theoretic measures. The agreement between the scores for these measures obtained on the basis of ASR-generated vs. manual transcriptions was determined through correlation analysis. A more differential effect of ASR performance on specific types of complexity measures when controlling for task type effects is also presented."
49,The Topic Confusion Task: A Novel Scenario for Authorship Attribution,"Authorship attribution is the problem of identifying the most plausible author of an anonymous text from a set of candidate authors. Researchers have investigated same-topic and cross-topic scenarios of authorship attribution, which differ according to whether new, unseen topics are used in the testing phase. However, neither scenario allows us to explain whether errors are caused by a failure to capture authorship writing style or by a topic shift. Motivated by this, we propose the \emph{topic confusion} task where we switch the author-topic configuration between the training and testing sets. This setup allows us to distinguish two types of errors: those caused by the topic shift and those caused by the features' inability to capture the writing styles. We show that stylometric features with part-of-speech tags are the least susceptible to topic variations. We further show that combining them with other features leads to significantly lower topic confusion and higher attribution accuracy. Finally, we show that pretrained language models such as BERT and RoBERTa perform poorly on this task and are surpassed by simple features such as word-level $n$-grams."
50,The challenges of temporal alignment on Twitter during crises,"Language use changes over time, and this impacts the effectiveness of NLP systems. This phenomenon is even more prevalent in social media data during crisis events where meaning and frequency of word usage may change over the course of days. Contextual language models fail to adapt temporally, emphasizing the need for temporal adaptation in models which need to be deployed over an extended period of time. While existing approaches consider data spanning large periods of time (from years to decades), shorter time spans are critical for crisis data. We quantify temporal degradation for this scenario and propose methods to cope with performance loss by leveraging techniques from domain adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore effects of rapid language change driven by adversarial adaptations, particularly during natural and human-induced disasters. Through extensive experimentation on diverse crisis datasets, we analyze under what conditions our approaches outperform strong baselines while highlighting the current limitations of temporal adaptation methods in scenarios where access to unlabeled data is scarce."
51,Multi-Perspective Abstractive Answer Summarization,"Community Question Answering (CQA) forums such as Stack Overflow and Yahoo! Answers contain a rich resource of answers to a wide range of questions. Each question thread can receive a large number of answers with different perspectives. The goal of multi-perspective answer summarization is to produce a summary that includes all perspectives of the answer. A major obstacle for multi-perspective, abstractive answer summarization is the absence of a dataset to provide supervision for producing such summaries. This work introduces a novel dataset creation method to automatically create multi-perspective, bullet-point abstractive summaries from an existing CQA forum. Supervision provided by this dataset trains models to inherently produce multi-perspective summaries. Additionally, to train models to output more diverse, faithful answer summaries while retaining multiple perspectives, we propose a multi-reward optimization technique coupled with a sentence-relevance prediction multi-task loss. Our methods demonstrate improved coverage of perspectives and faithfulness as measured by automatic and human evaluations compared to a strong baseline."
52,DWUG: A large Resource of Diachronic Word Usage Graphs in Four Languages,"Word meaning is notoriously difficult to capture, both synchronically and diachronically. In this paper, we describe the creation of the largest resource of graded contextualized, diachronic word meaning annotation in four different languages, based on 100,000 human semantic proximity judgments. We thoroughly describe the multi-round incremental annotation process, the choice for a clustering algorithm to group usages into senses, and possible - diachronic and synchronic - uses for this dataset."
53,Crossing the Conversational Chasm: A Primer on Natural Language   Processing for Multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"In task-oriented dialogue (ToD), a user holds a conversation with an artificial agent to complete a concrete task. Although this technology represents one of the central objectives of AI and has been the focus of ever more intense research and development efforts, it is currently limited to a few narrow domains (e.g., food ordering, ticket booking) and a handful of languages (e.g., English, Chinese). This work provides an extensive overview of existing methods and resources in multilingual ToD as an entry point to this exciting and emerging field. We find that the most critical factor preventing the creation of truly multilingual ToD systems is the lack of datasets in most languages for both training and evaluation. In fact, acquiring annotations or human feedback for each component of modular systems or for data-hungry end-to-end systems is expensive and tedious. Hence, state-of-the-art approaches to multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or few-shot) cross-lingual transfer from resource-rich languages (almost exclusively English), either by means of machine translation or multilingual representations. These approaches are currently viable only for typologically similar languages and languages with parallel / monolingual corpora available. On the other hand, their effectiveness beyond these boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the lack of linguistically diverse benchmarks (especially for natural language generation and end-to-end evaluation). To overcome this limitation, we draw parallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks, which can inspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list additional challenges that multilinguality poses for related areas (such as speech and human-centred evaluation), and indicate future directions that hold promise to further expand language coverage and dialogue capabilities of current ToD systems."
54,Sentence Alignment with Parallel Documents Facilitates Biomedical   Machine Translation,"Objective: Today's neural machine translation (NMT) can achieve near human-level translation quality and greatly facilitates international communications, but the lack of parallel corpora poses a key problem to the development of translation systems for highly specialized domains, such as biomedicine. This work presents an unsupervised algorithm for deriving parallel corpora from document-level translations by using sentence alignment and explores how training materials affect the performance of biomedical NMT systems. Materials and Methods: Document-level translations are mixed to train bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) for the evaluation of cross-lingual word similarity, and sentence distance is defined by combining semantic and positional similarities of the sentences. The alignment of sentences is formulated as an extended earth mover's distance problem. A Chinese-English biomedical parallel corpus is derived with the proposed algorithm using bilingual articles from UpToDate and translations of PubMed abstracts, which is then used for the training and evaluation of NMT. Results: On two manually aligned translation datasets, the proposed algorithm achieved accurate sentence alignment in the 1-to-1 cases and outperformed competing algorithms in the many-to-many cases. The NMT model fine-tuned on biomedical data significantly improved the in-domain translation quality (zh-en: +17.72 BLEU; en-zh: +17.02 BLEU). Both the size of the training data and the combination of different corpora can significantly affect the model's performance. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm relaxes the assumption for sentence alignment and effectively generates accurate translation pairs that facilitate training high quality biomedical NMT models."
55,XLEnt: Mining a Large Cross-lingual Entity Dataset with   Lexical-Semantic-Phonetic Word Alignment,"Cross-lingual named-entity lexica are an important resource to multilingual NLP tasks such as machine translation and cross-lingual wikification. While knowledge bases contain a large number of entities in high-resource languages such as English and French, corresponding entities for lower-resource languages are often missing. To address this, we propose Lexical-Semantic-Phonetic Align (LSP-Align), a technique to automatically mine cross-lingual entity lexica from mined web data. We demonstrate LSP-Align outperforms baselines at extracting cross-lingual entity pairs and mine 164 million entity pairs from 120 different languages aligned with English. We release these cross-lingual entity pairs along with the massively multilingual tagged named entity corpus as a resource to the NLP community."
56,A Stylistic Analysis of Honest Deception: The Case of Seinfeld TV Series   Sitcom,"Language is a powerful tool if used in the correct manner. It is the major mode of communication, and using the correct choice of words and styles can serve to have a long-lasting impact. Stylistics is the study of the use of various language styles in communication to pass a message with a bigger impact or to communicate indirectly. Stylistic analysis, therefore, is the study of the use of linguistic styles in texts to determine how a style has been used, what is communicated and how it is communicated. Honest deception is the use of a choice of words to imply something different from the literal meaning. A person listening or reading a text where honest deception has been used and with a literal understanding may completely miss out on the point. This is because the issue of honesty and falsehood arises. However, it would be better to understand that honest deception is used with the intention of having a lasting impact rather than to deceive the readers, viewers or listeners. The major styles used in honest deception are hyperboles, litotes, irony and sarcasm. The Seinfeld Sitcom TV series was a situational TV comedy show aired from 1990 to 1998. the show attempts to bring to the understanding the daily life of a comedian and how comedian views life experiences and convert them into hilarious jokes. It also shows Jerry's struggle with getting the right partner from the many women who come into his life. Reflecting on honest deception in the Seinfeld sitcom TV series, this paper is going to investigate how honest deception has been used in the series, why it has been used and what is being communicated. The study is going to use a recapitulative form to give a better analysis and grouping of the different styles used in honest deception throughout the series."
57,Who Responded to Whom: The Joint Effects of Latent Topics and Discourse   in Conversation Structure,"Numerous online conversations are produced on a daily basis, resulting in a pressing need to conversation understanding. As a basis to structure a discussion, we identify the responding relations in the conversation discourse, which link response utterances to their initiations. To figure out who responded to whom, here we explore how the consistency of topic contents and dependency of discourse roles indicate such interactions, whereas most prior work ignore the effects of latent factors underlying word occurrences. We propose a model to learn latent topics and discourse in word distributions, and predict pairwise initiation-response links via exploiting topic consistency and discourse dependency. Experimental results on both English and Chinese conversations show that our model significantly outperforms the previous state of the arts, such as 79 vs. 73 MRR on Chinese customer service dialogues. We further probe into our outputs and shed light on how topics and discourse indicate conversational user interactions."
58,Emotion Classification in a Resource Constrained Language Using   Transformer-based Approach,"Although research on emotion classification has significantly progressed in high-resource languages, it is still infancy for resource-constrained languages like Bengali. However, unavailability of necessary language processing tools and deficiency of benchmark corpora makes the emotion classification task in Bengali more challenging and complicated. This work proposes a transformer-based technique to classify the Bengali text into one of the six basic emotions: anger, fear, disgust, sadness, joy, and surprise. A Bengali emotion corpus consists of 6243 texts is developed for the classification task. Experimentation carried out using various machine learning (LR, RF, MNB, SVM), deep neural networks (CNN, BiLSTM, CNN+BiLSTM) and transformer (Bangla-BERT, m-BERT, XLM-R) based approaches. Experimental outcomes indicate that XLM-R outdoes all other techniques by achieving the highest weighted $f_1$-score of $69.73\%$ on the test data. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/omar-sharif03/NAACL-SRW-2021."
59,UPB at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Virtual Adversarial Training for Toxic Spans   Detection,"The real-world impact of polarization and toxicity in the online sphere marked the end of 2020 and the beginning of this year in a negative way. Semeval-2021, Task 5 - Toxic Spans Detection is based on a novel annotation of a subset of the Jigsaw Unintended Bias dataset and is the first language toxicity detection task dedicated to identifying the toxicity-level spans. For this task, participants had to automatically detect character spans in short comments that render the message as toxic. Our model considers applying Virtual Adversarial Training in a semi-supervised setting during the fine-tuning process of several Transformer-based models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTa), in combination with Conditional Random Fields. Our approach leads to performance improvements and more robust models, enabling us to achieve an F1-score of 65.73% in the official submission and an F1-score of 66.13% after further tuning during post-evaluation."
60,AM2iCo: Evaluating Word Meaning in Context across Low-Resource Languages   with Adversarial Examples,"Capturing word meaning in context and distinguishing between correspondences and variations across languages is key to building successful multilingual and cross-lingual text representation models. However, existing multilingual evaluation datasets that evaluate lexical semantics ""in-context"" have various limitations. In particular, 1) their language coverage is restricted to high-resource languages and skewed in favor of only a few language families and areas, 2) a design that makes the task solvable via superficial cues, which results in artificially inflated (and sometimes super-human) performances of pretrained encoders, on many target languages, which limits their usefulness for model probing and diagnostics, and 3) little support for cross-lingual evaluation. In order to address these gaps, we present AM2iCo (Adversarial and Multilingual Meaning in Context), a wide-coverage cross-lingual and multilingual evaluation set; it aims to faithfully assess the ability of state-of-the-art (SotA) representation models to understand the identity of word meaning in cross-lingual contexts for 14 language pairs. We conduct a series of experiments in a wide range of setups and demonstrate the challenging nature of AM2iCo. The results reveal that current SotA pretrained encoders substantially lag behind human performance, and the largest gaps are observed for low-resource languages and languages dissimilar to English."
61,Customized determination of stop words using Random Matrix Theory   approach,"The distances between words calculated in word units are studied and compared with the distributions of the Random Matrix Theory (RMT). It is found that the distribution of distance between the same words can be well described by the single-parameter Brody distribution. Using the Brody distribution fit, we found that the distance between given words in a set of texts can show mixed dynamics, coexisting regular and chaotic regimes. It is found that distributions correctly fitted by the Brody distribution with a certain goodness of the fit threshold can be identifid as stop words, usually considered as the uninformative part of the text. By applying various threshold values for the goodness of fit, we can extract uninformative words from the texts under analysis to the desired extent. On this basis we formulate a fully agnostic recipe that can be used in the creation of a customized set of stop words for texts in any language based on words."
62,Improving Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning via Robust Training,"Pre-trained multilingual language encoders, such as multilingual BERT and XLM-R, show great potential for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. However, these multilingual encoders do not precisely align words and phrases across languages. Especially, learning alignments in the multilingual embedding space usually requires sentence-level or word-level parallel corpora, which are expensive to be obtained for low-resource languages. An alternative is to make the multilingual encoders more robust; when fine-tuning the encoder using downstream task, we train the encoder to tolerate noise in the contextual embedding spaces such that even if the representations of different languages are not aligned well, the model can still achieve good performance on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. In this work, we propose a learning strategy for training robust models by drawing connections between adversarial examples and the failure cases of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. We adopt two widely used robust training methods, adversarial training and randomized smoothing, to train the desired robust model. The experimental results demonstrate that robust training improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on text classification tasks. The improvement is more significant in the generalized cross-lingual transfer setting, where the pair of input sentences belong to two different languages."
63,Competency Problems: On Finding and Removing Artifacts in Language Data,"Much recent work in NLP has documented dataset artifacts, bias, and spurious correlations between input features and output labels. However, how to tell which features have ""spurious"" instead of legitimate correlations is typically left unspecified. In this work we argue that for complex language understanding tasks, all simple feature correlations are spurious, and we formalize this notion into a class of problems which we call competency problems. For example, the word ""amazing"" on its own should not give information about a sentiment label independent of the context in which it appears, which could include negation, metaphor, sarcasm, etc. We theoretically analyze the difficulty of creating data for competency problems when human bias is taken into account, showing that realistic datasets will increasingly deviate from competency problems as dataset size increases. This analysis gives us a simple statistical test for dataset artifacts, which we use to show more subtle biases than were described in prior work, including demonstrating that models are inappropriately affected by these less extreme biases. Our theoretical treatment of this problem also allows us to analyze proposed solutions, such as making local edits to dataset instances, and to give recommendations for future data collection and model design efforts that target competency problems."
64,Learning from Noisy Labels for Entity-Centric Information Extraction,"Recent information extraction approaches have relied on training deep neural models. However, such models can easily overfit noisy labels and suffer from performance degradation. While it is very costly to filter noisy labels in large learning resources, recent studies show that such labels take more training steps to be memorized and are more frequently forgotten than clean labels, therefore are identifiable in training. Motivated by such properties, we propose a simple co-regularization framework for entity-centric information extraction, which consists of several neural models with identical structures but different parameter initialization. These models are jointly optimized with the task-specific losses and are regularized to generate similar predictions based on an agreement loss, which prevents overfitting on noisy labels. Extensive experiments on two widely used but noisy benchmarks for information extraction, TACRED and CoNLL03, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We release our code to the community for future research."
65,Monotonicity Marking from Universal Dependency Trees,"Dependency parsing is a tool widely used in the field of Natural language processing and computational linguistics. However, there is hardly any work that connects dependency parsing to monotonicity, which is an essential part of logic and linguistic semantics. In this paper, we present a system that automatically annotates monotonicity information based on Universal Dependency parse trees. Our system utilizes surface-level monotonicity facts about quantifiers, lexical items, and token-level polarity information. We compared our system's performance with existing systems in the literature, including NatLog and ccg2mono, on a small evaluation dataset. Results show that our system outperforms NatLog and ccg2mono."
66,Characterizing Idioms: Conventionality and Contingency,"Idioms are unlike most phrases in two important ways. First, the words in an idiom have non-canonical meanings. Second, the non-canonical meanings of words in an idiom are contingent on the presence of other words in the idiom. Linguistic theories differ on whether these properties depend on one another, as well as whether special theoretical machinery is needed to accommodate idioms. We define two measures that correspond to the properties above, and we implement them using BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and XLNet(Yang et al., 2019). We show that idioms fall at the expected intersection of the two dimensions, but that the dimensions themselves are not correlated. Our results suggest that special machinery to handle idioms may not be warranted."
67,Worst of Both Worlds: Biases Compound in Pre-trained Vision-and-Language   Models,"Numerous works have analyzed biases in vision and pre-trained language models individually - however, less attention has been paid to how these biases interact in multimodal settings. This work extends text-based bias analysis methods to investigate multimodal language models, and analyzes intra- and inter-modality associations and biases learned by these models. Specifically, we demonstrate that VL-BERT (Su et al., 2020) exhibits gender biases, often preferring to reinforce a stereotype over faithfully describing the visual scene. We demonstrate these findings on a controlled case-study and extend them for a larger set of stereotypically gendered entities."
68,Generating Related Work,"Communicating new research ideas involves highlighting similarities and differences with past work. Authors write fluent, often long sections to survey the distinction of a new paper with related work. In this work we model generating related work sections while being cognisant of the motivation behind citing papers. Our content planning model generates a tree of cited papers before a surface realization model lexicalizes this skeleton. Our model outperforms several strong state-of-the-art summarization and multi-document summarization models on generating related work on an ACL Anthology (AA) based dataset which we contribute."
69,When Does Pretraining Help? Assessing Self-Supervised Learning for Law   and the CaseHOLD Dataset,"While self-supervised learning has made rapid advances in natural language processing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in resource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law, puzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case Holdings On Legal Decisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second, we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books and Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (using corpus of approximately 3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than BERT's) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12% improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain specificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage resource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures, too, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language."
70,Guilt by Association: Emotion Intensities in Lexical Representations,"What do word vector representations reveal about the emotions associated with words? In this study, we consider the task of estimating word-level emotion intensity scores for specific emotions, exploring unsupervised, supervised, and finally a self-supervised method of extracting emotional associations from word vector representations. Overall, we find that word vectors carry substantial potential for inducing fine-grained emotion intensity scores, showing a far higher correlation with human ground truth ratings than achieved by state-of-the-art emotion lexicons."
71,The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning,"In this work, we explore ""prompt tuning"", a simple yet effective mechanism for learning ""soft prompts"" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signal from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's ""few-shot"" learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant in that large models are costly to share and serve, and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ""prefix tuning"" of Li and Liang (2021), and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer, as compared to full model tuning."
72,MT6: Multilingual Pretrained Text-to-Text Transformer with Translation   Pairs,"Multilingual T5 (mT5) pretrains a sequence-to-sequence model on massive monolingual texts, which has shown promising results on many cross-lingual tasks. In this paper, we improve multilingual text-to-text transfer Transformer with translation pairs (mT6). Specifically, we explore three cross-lingual text-to-text pre-training tasks, namely, machine translation, translation pair span corruption, and translation span corruption. In addition, we propose a partially non-autoregressive objective for text-to-text pre-training. We evaluate the methods on eight multilingual benchmark datasets, including sentence classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and abstractive summarization. Experimental results show that the proposed mT6 improves cross-lingual transferability over mT5."
73,Knowledge Neurons in Pretrained Transformers,"Large-scale pretrained language models are surprisingly good at recalling factual knowledge presented in the training corpus. In this paper, we present preliminary studies on how factual knowledge is stored in pretrained Transformers by introducing the concept of knowledge neurons. Specifically, we examine the fill-in-the-blank cloze task for BERT. Given a relational fact, we propose a knowledge attribution method to identify the neurons that express the fact. We find that the activation of such knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the expression of their corresponding facts. In our case studies, we attempt to leverage knowledge neurons to edit (such as update, and erase) specific factual knowledge without fine-tuning. Our results shed light on understanding the storage of knowledge within pretrained Transformers. The code is available at https://github.com/Hunter-DDM/knowledge-neurons."
74,Intent Features for Rich Natural Language Understanding,"Complex natural language understanding modules in dialog systems have a richer understanding of user utterances, and thus are critical in providing a better user experience. However, these models are often created from scratch, for specific clients and use cases, and require the annotation of large datasets. This encourages the sharing of annotated data across multiple clients. To facilitate this we introduce the idea of intent features: domain and topic agnostic properties of intents that can be learned from the syntactic cues only, and hence can be shared. We introduce a new neural network architecture, the Global-Local model, that shows significant improvement over strong baselines for identifying these features in a deployed, multi-intent natural language understanding module, and, more generally, in a classification setting where a part of an utterance has to be classified utilizing the whole context."
75,Simple and Efficient ways to Improve REALM,"Dense retrieval has been shown to be effective for retrieving relevant documents for Open Domain QA, surpassing popular sparse retrieval methods like BM25. REALM (Guu et al., 2020) is an end-to-end dense retrieval system that relies on MLM based pretraining for improved downstream QA efficiency across multiple datasets. We study the finetuning of REALM on various QA tasks and explore the limits of various hyperparameter and supervision choices. We find that REALM was significantly undertrained when finetuning and simple improvements in the training, supervision, and inference setups can significantly benefit QA results and exceed the performance of other models published post it. Our best model, REALM++, incorporates all the best working findings and achieves significant QA accuracy improvements over baselines (~5.5% absolute accuracy) without any model design changes. Additionally, REALM++ matches the performance of large Open Domain QA models which have 3x more parameters demonstrating the efficiency of the setup."
76,PaCo: Preconditions Attributed to Commonsense Knowledge,"Humans can seamlessly reason with circumstantial preconditions of commonsense knowledge. We understand that a glass is used for drinking water, unless the glass is broken or the water is toxic. Despite state-of-the-art (SOTA) language models' (LMs) impressive performance on inferring commonsense knowledge, it is unclear whether they understand the circumstantial preconditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel challenge of reasoning with circumstantial preconditions. We collect a dataset, called PaCo, consisting of 12.4 thousand preconditions of commonsense statements expressed in natural language. Based on this dataset, we create three canonical evaluation tasks and use them to examine the capability of existing LMs to understand situational preconditions. Our results reveal a 10-30% gap between machine and human performance on our tasks, which shows that reasoning with preconditions is an open challenge."
77,Embedding-Enhanced Giza++: Improving Alignment in Low- and High-   Resource Scenarios Using Embedding Space Geometry,"A popular natural language processing task decades ago, word alignment has been dominated until recently by GIZA++, a statistical method based on the 30-year-old IBM models. New methods that outperform GIZA++ primarily rely on large machine translation models, massively multilingual language models, or supervision from GIZA++ alignments itself. We introduce Embedding-Enhanced GIZA++, and outperform GIZA++ without any of the aforementioned factors. Taking advantage of monolingual embedding spaces of source and target language only, we exceed GIZA++'s performance in every tested scenario for three languages pairs. In the lowest-resource setting, we outperform GIZA++ by 8.5, 10.9, and 12 AER for Ro-En, De-En, and En-Fr, respectively. We release our code at https://github.com/kellymarchisio/ee-giza."
78,News Meets Microblog: Hashtag Annotation via Retriever-Generator,"Hashtag annotation for microblog posts has been recently formulated as a sequence generation problem to handle emerging hashtags that are unseen in the training set. The state-of-the-art method leverages conversations initiated by posts to enrich contextual information for the short posts. However, it is unrealistic to assume the existence of conversations before the hashtag annotation itself. Therefore, we propose to leverage news articles published before the microblog post to generate hashtags following a Retriever-Generator framework. Extensive experiments on English Twitter datasets demonstrate superior performance and significant advantages of leveraging news articles to generate hashtags."
79,"Extract, Denoise and Enforce: Evaluating and Improving Concept   Preservation for Text-to-Text Generation","Prior studies on text-to-text generation typically assume that the model could figure out what to attend to in the input and what to include in the output via seq2seq learning, with only the parallel training data and no additional guidance. However, it remains unclear whether current models can preserve important concepts in the source input, as seq2seq learning does not have explicit focus on the concepts and commonly used evaluation metrics also treat concepts equally important as other tokens. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis that studies whether current seq2seq models, especially pre-trained language models, are good enough for preserving important input concepts and to what extent explicitly guiding generation with the concepts as lexical constraints is beneficial. We answer the above questions by conducting extensive analytical experiments on four representative text-to-text generation tasks. Based on the observations, we then propose a simple yet effective framework to automatically extract, denoise, and enforce important input concepts as lexical constraints. This new method performs comparably or better than its unconstrained counterpart on automatic metrics, demonstrates higher coverage for concept preservation, and receives better ratings in the human evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/morningmoni/EDE."
80,AmericasNLI: Evaluating Zero-shot Natural Language Understanding of   Pretrained Multilingual Models in Truly Low-resource Languages,"Pretrained multilingual models are able to perform cross-lingual transfer in a zero-shot setting, even for languages unseen during pretraining. However, prior work evaluating performance on unseen languages has largely been limited to low-level, syntactic tasks, and it remains unclear if zero-shot learning of high-level, semantic tasks is possible for unseen languages. To explore this question, we present AmericasNLI, an extension of XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018) to 10 indigenous languages of the Americas. We conduct experiments with XLM-R, testing multiple zero-shot and translation-based approaches. Additionally, we explore model adaptation via continued pretraining and provide an analysis of the dataset by considering hypothesis-only models. We find that XLM-R's zero-shot performance is poor for all 10 languages, with an average performance of 38.62%. Continued pretraining offers improvements, with an average accuracy of 44.05%. Surprisingly, training on poorly translated data by far outperforms all other methods with an accuracy of 48.72%."
81,Revealing Persona Biases in Dialogue Systems,"Dialogue systems in the form of chatbots and personal assistants are being increasingly integrated into people's lives. Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics."
82,Learning with Instance Bundles for Reading Comprehension,"When training most modern reading comprehension models, all the questions associated with a context are treated as being independent from each other. However, closely related questions and their corresponding answers are not independent, and leveraging these relationships could provide a strong supervision signal to a model. Drawing on ideas from contrastive estimation, we introduce several new supervision techniques that compare question-answer scores across multiple related instances. Specifically, we normalize these scores across various neighborhoods of closely contrasting questions and/or answers, adding another cross entropy loss term that is used in addition to traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our techniques require bundles of related question-answer pairs, which we can either mine from within existing data or create using various automated heuristics. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of training with instance bundles on two datasets -- HotpotQA and ROPES -- showing up to 11% absolute gains in accuracy."
83,CEAR: Cross-Entity Aware Reranker for Knowledge Base Completion,"Pre-trained language models (LMs) like BERT have shown to store factual knowledge about the world. This knowledge can be used to augment the information present in Knowledge Bases, which tend to be incomplete. However, prior attempts at using BERT for task of Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) resulted in performance worse than embedding based techniques that rely only on the graph structure. In this work we develop a novel model, Cross-Entity Aware Reranker (CEAR), that uses BERT to re-rank the output of existing KBC models with cross-entity attention. Unlike prior work that scores each entity independently, CEAR uses BERT to score the entities together, which is effective for exploiting its factual knowledge. CEAR achieves a new state of art for the OLPBench dataset."
84,Go Forth and Prosper: Language Modeling with Ancient Textual History,"We introduce a technique for improving document-level language models (LM) by leveraging ""ancient history"": text that is outside the LM's current context window. We learn an auxiliary function to select spans from the ancient history which can help the LM to predict future text. The selected text spans are then copied directly into the LM's context window, replacing less predictive spans. This method can improve perplexity of pretrained LMs with no updates to the LM's own parameters. We further observe that an auxiliary function trained in a specific textual domain like Wikipedia will also work in a substantially different domain such as scientific publications. With this technique we see a 7 percent perplexity reduction on Wikipedia articles, and a 12 percent perplexity reduction on scientific texts."
85,Generative Context Pair Selection for Multi-hop Question Answering,"Compositional reasoning tasks like multi-hop question answering, require making latent decisions to get the final answer, given a question. However, crowdsourced datasets often capture only a slice of the underlying task distribution, which can induce unanticipated biases in models performing compositional reasoning. Furthermore, discriminatively trained models exploit such biases to get a better held-out performance, without learning the right way to reason, as they do not necessitate paying attention to the question representation (conditioning variable) in its entirety, to estimate the answer likelihood. In this work, we propose a generative context selection model for multi-hop question answering that reasons about how the given question could have been generated given a context pair. While being comparable to the state-of-the-art answering performance, our proposed generative passage selection model has a better performance (4.9% higher than baseline) on adversarial held-out set which tests robustness of model's multi-hop reasoning capabilities."
86,Zero-shot Cross-lingual Transfer of Neural Machine Translation with   Multilingual Pretrained Encoders,"Previous work mainly focuses on improving cross-lingual transfer for NLU tasks with a multilingual pretrained encoder (MPE), or improving the performance on supervised machine translation with BERT. However, it is under-explored that whether the MPE can help to facilitate the cross-lingual transferability of NMT model. In this paper, we focus on a zero-shot cross-lingual transfer task in NMT. In this task, the NMT model is trained with parallel dataset of only one language pair and an off-the-shelf MPE, then it is directly tested on zero-shot language pairs. We propose SixT, a simple yet effective model for this task. SixT leverages the MPE with a two-stage training schedule and gets further improvement with a position disentangled encoder and a capacity-enhanced decoder. Using this method, SixT significantly outperforms mBART, a pretrained multilingual encoder-decoder model explicitly designed for NMT, with an average improvement of 7.1 BLEU on zero-shot any-to-English test sets across 14 source languages. Furthermore, with much less training computation cost and training data, our model achieves better performance on 15 any-to-English test sets than CRISS and m2m-100, two strong multilingual NMT baselines."
87,Improving Neural Model Performance through Natural Language Feedback on   Their Explanations,"A class of explainable NLP models for reasoning tasks support their decisions by generating free-form or structured explanations, but what happens when these supporting structures contain errors? Our goal is to allow users to interactively correct explanation structures through natural language feedback. We introduce MERCURIE - an interactive system that refines its explanations for a given reasoning task by getting human feedback in natural language. Our approach generates graphs that have 40% fewer inconsistencies as compared with the off-the-shelf system. Further, simply appending the corrected explanation structures to the output leads to a gain of 1.2 points on accuracy on defeasible reasoning across all three domains. We release a dataset of over 450k graphs for defeasible reasoning generated by our system at https://tinyurl.com/mercurie ."
88,Constrained Language Models Yield Few-Shot Semantic Parsers,"We explore the use of large pretrained language models as few-shot semantic parsers. The goal in semantic parsing is to generate a structured meaning representation given a natural language input. However, language models are trained to generate natural language. To bridge the gap, we use language models to paraphrase inputs into a controlled sublanguage resembling English that can be automatically mapped to a target meaning representation. Our results demonstrate that with only a small amount of data and very little code to convert into English-like representations, our blueprint for rapidly bootstrapping semantic parsers leads to surprisingly effective performance on multiple community tasks, greatly exceeding baseline methods also trained on the same limited data."
89,Cross-Attention is All You Need: Adapting Pretrained Transformers for   Machine Translation,"We study the power of cross-attention in the Transformer architecture within the context of transfer learning for machine translation, and extend the findings of studies into cross-attention when training from scratch. We conduct a series of experiments through fine-tuning a translation model on data where either the source or target language has changed. These experiments reveal that fine-tuning only the cross-attention parameters is nearly as effective as fine-tuning all parameters (i.e., the entire translation model). We provide insights into why this is the case and observe that limiting fine-tuning in this manner yields cross-lingually aligned embeddings. The implications of this finding for researchers and practitioners include a mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, the potential for zero-shot translation, and the ability to extend machine translation models to several new language pairs with reduced parameter storage overhead."
90,On the Sensitivity and Stability of Model Interpretations in NLP,"Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a variety of post-hoc interpretations that aim to uncover how natural language processing (NLP) models make predictions. Despite the surge of new interpretation methods, it remains an open problem how to define and quantitatively measure the faithfulness of interpretations, i.e., to what extent interpretations reflect the reasoning process by a model. We propose two new criteria, sensitivity and stability, that provide complementary notions of faithfulness to the existed removal-based criteria. Our results show that the conclusion for how faithful interpretations are could vary substantially based on different notions. Motivated by the desiderata of sensitivity and stability, we introduce a new class of interpretation methods that adopt techniques from adversarial robustness. Empirical results show that our proposed methods are effective under the new criteria and overcome limitations of gradient-based methods on removal-based criteria. Besides text classification, we also apply interpretation methods and metrics to dependency parsing. Our results shed light on understanding the diverse set of interpretations."
91,Chinese Sentences Similarity via Cross-Attention Based Siamese Network,"Measuring sentence similarity is a key research area nowadays as it allows machines to better understand human languages. In this paper, we proposed a Cross-Attention Siamese Network (CATsNet) to carry out the task of learning the semantic meanings of Chinese sentences and comparing the similarity between two sentences. This novel model is capable of catching non-local features. Additionally, we also tried to apply the long short-term memory (LSTM) network in the model to improve its performance. The experiments were conducted on the LCQMC dataset and the results showed that our model could achieve a higher accuracy than previous work."
92,Misinfo Reaction Frames: Reasoning about Readers' Reactions to News   Headlines,"Even to a simple and short news headline, readers react in a multitude of ways: cognitively (e.g. inferring the writer's intent), emotionally (e.g. feeling distrust), and behaviorally (e.g. sharing the news with their friends). Such reactions are instantaneous and yet complex, as they rely on factors that go beyond interpreting factual content of news. We propose Misinfo Reaction Frames (MRF), a pragmatic formalism for modeling how readers might react to a news headline. In contrast to categorical schema, our free-text dimensions provide a more nuanced way of understanding intent beyond being benign or malicious. We also introduce a Misinfo Reaction Frames corpus, a crowdsourced dataset of reactions to over 25k news headlines focusing on global crises: the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and cancer. Empirical results confirm that it is indeed possible for neural models to predict the prominent patterns of readers' reactions to previously unseen news headlines. Additionally, our user study shows that displaying machine-generated MRF implications alongside news headlines to readers can increase their trust in real news while decreasing their trust in misinformation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and importance of pragmatic inferences on news headlines to help enhance AI-guided misinformation detection and mitigation."
93,Keyphrase Generation with Fine-Grained Evaluation-Guided Reinforcement   Learning,"Aiming to generate a set of keyphrases, Keyphrase Generation (KG) is a classical task for capturing the central idea from a given document. Based on Seq2Seq models, the previous reinforcement learning framework on KG tasks utilizes the evaluation metrics to further improve the well-trained neural models. However, these KG evaluation metrics such as $F_1@5$ and $F_1@M$ are only aware of the exact correctness of predictions on phrase-level and ignore the semantic similarities between similar predictions and targets, which inhibits the model from learning deep linguistic patterns. In response to this problem, we propose a new fine-grained evaluation metric to improve the RL framework, which considers different granularities: token-level $F_1$ score, edit distance, duplication, and prediction quantities. On the whole, the new framework includes two reward functions: the fine-grained evaluation score and the vanilla $F_1$ score. This framework helps the model identifying some partial match phrases which can be further optimized as the exact match ones. Experiments on KG benchmarks show that our proposed training framework outperforms the previous RL training frameworks among all evaluation scores. In addition, our method can effectively ease the synonym problem and generate a higher quality prediction. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/xuyige/FGRL4KG}."
94,"Learn Continually, Generalize Rapidly: Lifelong Knowledge Accumulation   for Few-shot Learning","The ability to continuously expand knowledge over time and utilize it to rapidly generalize to new tasks is a key feature of human linguistic intelligence. Existing models that pursue rapid generalization to new tasks (e.g., few-shot learning methods), however, are mostly trained in a single shot on fixed datasets, unable to dynamically expand their knowledge; while continual learning algorithms are not specifically designed for rapid generalization. We present a new learning setup, Continual Learning of Few-Shot Learners (CLIF), to address the challenges of both learning settings in a unified setup. CLIF assumes a model learns from a sequence of diverse NLP tasks arriving sequentially, accumulating knowledge for improved generalization to new tasks, while also retaining performance on the tasks learned earlier. We examine how the generalization ability is affected in the continual learning setup, evaluate a number of continual learning algorithms, and propose a novel regularized adapter generation approach. We find that catastrophic forgetting affects generalization ability to a less degree than performance on seen tasks; while continual learning algorithms can still bring considerable benefit to the generalization ability."
95,Contrastive Out-of-Distribution Detection for Pretrained Transformers,"Pretrained Transformers achieve remarkable performance when training and test data are from the same distribution. However, in real-world scenarios, the model often faces out-of-distribution (OOD) instances that can cause severe semantic shift problems at inference time. Therefore, in practice, a reliable model should identify such instances, and then either reject them during inference or pass them over to models that handle another distribution. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised OOD detection method, in which only the in-distribution (ID) data are used in training. We propose to fine-tune the Transformers with a contrastive loss, which improves the compactness of representations, such that OOD instances can be better differentiated from ID ones. These OOD instances can then be accurately detected using the Mahalanobis distance in the model's penultimate layer. We experiment with comprehensive settings and achieve near-perfect OOD detection performance, outperforming baselines drastically. We further investigate the rationales behind the improvement, finding that more compact representations through margin-based contrastive learning bring the improvement. We release our code to the community for future research."
96,Stream-level Latency Evaluation for Simultaneous Machine Translation,"Simultaneous machine translation has recently gained traction thanks to significant quality improvements and the advent of streaming applications. Simultaneous translation systems need to find a trade-off between translation quality and response time, and with this purpose multiple latency measures have been proposed. However, latency evaluations for simultaneous translation are estimated at the sentence level, not taking into account the sequential nature of a streaming scenario. Indeed, these sentence-level latency measures are not well suited for continuous stream translation resulting in figures that are not coherent with the simultaneous translation policy of the system being assessed. This work proposes a stream-level adaptation of the current latency measures based on a re-segmentation approach applied to the output translation, that is successfully evaluated on streaming conditions for a reference IWSLT task."
97,LayoutXLM: Multimodal Pre-training for Multilingual Visually-rich   Document Understanding,"Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has achieved SOTA performance for visually-rich document understanding tasks recently, which demonstrates the great potential for joint learning across different modalities. In this paper, we present LayoutXLM, a multimodal pre-trained model for multilingual document understanding, which aims to bridge the language barriers for visually-rich document understanding. To accurately evaluate LayoutXLM, we also introduce a multilingual form understanding benchmark dataset named XFUND, which includes form understanding samples in 7 languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese), and key-value pairs are manually labeled for each language. Experiment results show that the LayoutXLM model has significantly outperformed the existing SOTA cross-lingual pre-trained models on the XFUND dataset. The pre-trained LayoutXLM model and the XFUND dataset are publicly available at https://aka.ms/layoutxlm."
98,Emotion-Regularized Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Emotional   Response Generation,"This paper presents an emotion-regularized conditional variational autoencoder (Emo-CVAE) model for generating emotional conversation responses. In conventional CVAE-based emotional response generation, emotion labels are simply used as additional conditions in prior, posterior and decoder networks. Considering that emotion styles are naturally entangled with semantic contents in the language space, the Emo-CVAE model utilizes emotion labels to regularize the CVAE latent space by introducing an extra emotion prediction network. In the training stage, the estimated latent variables are required to predict the emotion labels and token sequences of the input responses simultaneously. Experimental results show that our Emo-CVAE model can learn a more informative and structured latent space than a conventional CVAE model and output responses with better content and emotion performance than baseline CVAE and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models."
99,Language in a (Search) Box: Grounding Language Learning in Real-World   Human-Machine Interaction,"We investigate grounded language learning through real-world data, by modelling a teacher-learner dynamics through the natural interactions occurring between users and search engines; in particular, we explore the emergence of semantic generalization from unsupervised dense representations outside of synthetic environments. A grounding domain, a denotation function and a composition function are learned from user data only. We show how the resulting semantics for noun phrases exhibits compositional properties while being fully learnable without any explicit labelling. We benchmark our grounded semantics on compositionality and zero-shot inference tasks, and we show that it provides better results and better generalizations than SOTA non-grounded models, such as word2vec and BERT."
