# I320D_TextMining-NLP_FinalProject
Project by Yet Another Text Miners: Rory James, Nicola Rowe, Zachary Soo, and Thang Truong

# Overview
This project aims to apply different vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, word2vec, BERT, and ALL-MPNET) to compare and evaluate different search techniques. This repository contains the files created for the project.

# Goal
The goal of the project is to improve information retrieval for research papers in the Natural Language Processing domain.

# Features
- **Data Collection**: Files containing the data collection process (scrape.py and json_to_csv.py) as well as the final datasets (arxiv_results.csv, labeled_data.csv, and test_data.csv)
- **Evaluation**: Our experimentation in conducting the search for each of the vectorization techniques we used (compare_and_evaluate_different_models.ipynb)
- **Interactive demo**: Streamlit demo file (in streamlit folder) to allow users to simulate the effectiveness of our search engine
